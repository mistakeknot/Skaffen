# WASM Module Surface Census

Bead: `asupersync-umelq.2.1`  
Date: `2026-02-28`  
Purpose: enumerate workspace and module surfaces for browser viability with explicit required/optional/deferred classification, dependency fan-in/fan-out signals, and OS primitive assumptions.

## 1. Method and reproducibility

Data sources:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `README.md`
3. Workspace manifests (`Cargo.toml` + member `Cargo.toml` files)
4. Module inventory from `src/lib.rs` and `src/**`

Commands used to reproduce this census:

```bash
rg -n '^pub mod ' src/lib.rs
rg -n '^pub use ' src/lib.rs

# Workspace member manifests
sed -n '1,220p' asupersync-macros/Cargo.toml
sed -n '1,260p' conformance/Cargo.toml
sed -n '1,220p' franken_kernel/Cargo.toml
sed -n '1,220p' franken_evidence/Cargo.toml
sed -n '1,220p' franken_decision/Cargo.toml
sed -n '1,260p' frankenlab/Cargo.toml

# Platform/OS assumption probes
rg -n '^signal-hook\\s*=|^nix\\s*=|^libc\\s*=|^socket2\\s*=|^polling\\s*=' Cargo.toml
rg -n 'tokio' src/net -g '*.rs'
```

Fan-in/fan-out notes:

1. Fan-in is approximate file-level references to `crate::<module>`.
2. Fan-out is approximate count of unique `crate::<other_module>` targets imported by module files.
3. Values are used for triage and sequencing, not as exact dependency graph truth.

## 2. Workspace crate census

| Crate | Files | LOC | Local dependency fan-in | Local dependency fan-out | Browser role |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|---|
| `asupersync` | 517 | 475394 | consumed by `frankenlab` and external users | depends on `franken-kernel`, `franken-evidence`, `franken-decision`; optional `asupersync-macros`, optional `conformance` | Core runtime product |
| `asupersync-macros` | 7 | 2671 | optional feature in `asupersync` | `syn`, `quote`, `proc-macro2` | Optional ergonomics |
| `conformance` | 21 | 11722 | optional feature in `asupersync` and used in tests | `serde`, `serde_json`, `tempfile` | Required for parity validation |
| `franken-kernel` | 1 | 1607 | used by `asupersync` and `franken-decision` | `serde` | Optional evidence substrate |

| `franken-decision` | 1 | 1613 | used by `asupersync` | depends on `franken-kernel`, `franken-evidence`, `serde` | Optional policy/decision layer |
| `frankenlab` | 1 | 506 | standalone binary | depends on `asupersync` with `cli` + `test-internals` features | Tooling/dev harness, not browser runtime |

## 3. Public vs internal surface map

Public API anchors (from `src/lib.rs`):

1. Core re-exports: `Cx`, `Scope`, `Outcome`, `Budget`, `CancelKind`, `CancelReason`, `TaskId`, `RegionId`.
2. Runtime constructors: `RuntimeBuilder`, `LabConfig`, `LabRuntime`.
3. Structured protocol layers: channels, combinators, observability, trace, remote APIs.
4. Optional proc-macro exports behind `proc-macros` feature.

Internal-heavy surfaces (not suitable as browser public API as-is):

1. `runtime::reactor::*`, `runtime::io_driver`, `runtime::spawn_blocking` (native primitives and worker/thread assumptions).
2. `net::tcp`, `net::unix`, `fs::*`, `process`, `signal` (OS/socket/process coupling).
3. `server`, native listener stacks, and database wire clients for browser-inapplicable deployment shapes.

## 4. Module-by-module viability census (runtime crate)

Disposition classes:

1. `Required`: retained for browser subset (possibly with internal refactor).
2. `Adapter`: retained with browser-specific backend seam/capsule.
3. `Deferred`: out of browser v1 runtime scope.

| `io` | 5100 | 36 | 49 | 2 | Adapter | Abstract to browser event APIs and deterministic virtual backend. |
| `net` | 26261 | 22 | 121 | 14 | Adapter | Keep browser-relevant surfaces (fetch/websocket capsules), defer native socket internals. |
| `http` | 23082 | 8 | 54 | 1 | Adapter | Client-side protocol subset possible; server/listener paths out of v1. |
| `transport` | 10846 | 10 | 47 | 2 | Adapter | Multipath/routing semantics can remain with browser-safe IO substrate. |
| `service` | 5711 | 2 | 33 | 1 | Optional | Useful for middleware shape parity; not day-1 blocker. |
| `web` | 4138 | 8 | 13 | 1 | Optional | Candidate integration layer; define strict browser boundary first. |

| `server` | 1820 | 3 | 18 | 0 | Deferred | Server hosting paths are outside browser runtime mission. |

## 5. OS primitive and policy assumptions

Observed native assumptions:

1. `runtime` is the densest native-coupled area (epoll/kqueue/io_uring/libc/nix/polling).
2. `net` and `fs` contain heavy socket/OS API coupling.
3. `signal` and `process` are directly non-browser.
4. Manifest-level native dependencies that must stay out of wasm closure: `polling`, `socket2`, `libc`, `nix`, `signal-hook`.

Tokio policy check:

1. No direct `tokio` dependency line is currently present in root `Cargo.toml`.
2. One source mention exists in `src/net/quic_native/forensic_log.rs` documentation text (`no tokio / async`), not as an active runtime dependency path.

## 6. Environment matrix for browser census

Target matrix used for viability classification:

1. Browser engines: Chromium (primary), Firefox (secondary), WebKit/Safari (secondary).
2. Bundlers: Vite, Webpack, Turbopack.
3. Framework lanes: vanilla TS, React, Next.js App Router.
4. Runtime modes: live mode and deterministic mode.

Any module marked `Required` or `Adapter` must eventually produce evidence in at least one lane for each of the four matrix axes.

## 7. Outputs for downstream beads

Unblocks expected:

1. `asupersync-umelq.2.2`: portability classification now has concrete per-module disposition data.
2. `asupersync-umelq.2.3`: invariant parity obligations can attach directly to `Required` + `Adapter` rows.
3. `asupersync-umelq.3.4`: workspace slicing can derive feature/profile boundaries from this census.
4. `asupersync-umelq.2.5`: deferred-surface register can be seeded from all `Deferred` rows above.

Recommended next artifact:

1. A machine-readable ledger (`json` or `toml`) keyed by `module -> {disposition, invariants, test_requirements}` for CI gating and drift checks.

## 8. Portability classification details (`asupersync-umelq.2.2`)

Classification rules used:

1. `Portable`: no required native OS primitive boundary for semantic correctness in browser runtime mode.
2. `Adapter-required`: semantics are retained, but implementation needs browser capability capsules or platform backend seams.
3. `Deferred`: surface is non-essential for browser v1 and/or depends on native process, socket, file, or host networking responsibilities outside browser constraints.

1. `types`
2. `error`
3. `cancel`

7. `messaging`
8. `server`

### 8.1 Deferred-surface user impact and mitigation

| Deferred module | Why deferred | User-visible impact in browser v1 | Mitigation / future path |
|---|---|---|---|
| `fs` | depends on host file APIs and io_uring/native syscall paths | no direct file-descriptor style async fs API | route persistence through browser storage adapters (`IndexedDB`/`Cache`) in follow-up |
| `signal` | process signal model does not exist in browser sandbox | no POSIX-style signal handling hooks | represent lifecycle via browser visibility/unload events and explicit cancel tokens |
| `process` | browser has no child process model | no subprocess orchestration in browser runtime | keep subprocess features server-side; use worker-based abstractions where needed |
| `database` | current drivers target native wire/socket + blocking bridges | no embedded DB driver parity in wasm runtime | expose browser-safe data adapters and keep DB clients on server/backend tiers |
| `tls` | browser owns TLS stack under fetch/websocket APIs | no direct rustls-style tls config surface in browser runtime | rely on browser transport security; provide capability-level policy metadata only |
| `grpc` | current gRPC stack depends on transport layers not yet browser-parity-ready | no first-party browser gRPC endpoint runtime in v1 | revisit after browser transport/ABI stabilization; consider grpc-web compatibility lane |
| `messaging` | broker clients assume native sockets and host networking traits | no direct Kafka/NATS/Redis client in browser runtime | defer to backend gateways; browser interacts via fetch/websocket bridge |
| `server` | listener/accept loop model is host/server concern | no in-browser server hosting APIs | keep server runtime outside wasm browser profile |

## 9. Browser v1 "most useful subset" boundary (`asupersync-umelq.2.4`)

### 9.1 Include in v1 (high-value, invariant-safe)

1. Structured task orchestration core:
   - `types`, `error`, `cancel`, `obligation`, `record`, semantic `runtime` slice.
2. Capability-centric execution:
   - `cx`, `security`, capability wrappers needed for browser authority boundaries.
3. Deterministic correctness tooling:
   - `trace` deterministic event model, `lab` deterministic mode used in CI and replay.
4. Concurrency primitives needed by real browser apps:
   - selected `channel` and `sync` primitives with cancel-safe behavior.
5. Time and scheduling essentials:
   - browser-backed `time` and scheduler lanes with fairness and cancel-streak bounds.
6. Browser-relevant I/O adapters:
   - `io`/`net`/`http` subsets for fetch and websocket capsule flows.
7. Developer product surface:
   - stable wasm ABI + TS wrappers + React/Next integration layer for common app workflows.

### 9.2 Explicit non-goals for v1

1. Native socket/server hosting surfaces (`server`, native TCP/UNIX listener paths).
2. Native filesystem/process/signal surfaces (`fs`, `process`, `signal`).
3. Embedded database and broker client stacks (`database`, `messaging`).
4. First-party browser gRPC runtime parity in initial launch.
5. Full native parity for every optional feature flag in a single release.

### 9.3 Tradeoff rationale

1. Why this subset maximizes adoption:
   - it solves the highest-frequency frontend reliability problems (cancellation, structured ownership, deterministic replay) while avoiding low-ROI native-only scope.
2. Why this subset preserves semantics:
   - all non-negotiable invariants remain enforced in retained/adapted modules, with deferred areas clearly marked rather than silently degraded.
3. Why non-goals are explicit:
   - avoids accidental feature promises and keeps roadmap expectations auditable for users and CI gates.

### 9.4 User-facing impact statement

1. Supported v1 user jobs:
   - orchestrate async UI workflows with explicit cancel trees;
   - run deterministic replay for browser incidents;
   - integrate runtime semantics into TS, React, and Next client-side flows.
2. Deferred user jobs:
   - host servers in-browser, manage OS signals/processes, direct DB/broker wire clients from wasm runtime.
3. Migration expectation:
   - deferred jobs require backend service adapters in v1 and become candidates for phased expansion after parity gates are stable.

## 10. Workspace Slicing and Optionalization Strategy (`asupersync-umelq.3.4`)

### 10.1 Objective

Define a concrete workspace/package slicing plan so browser builds keep semantic
guarantees while minimizing payload and dependency closure.

### 10.2 Normative slices

| Slice ID | Included crates/modules | Browser profile target | Policy |
|---|---|---|---|
| `WS-CORE` | `asupersync` required + adapter-required module sets (Sections 8-9) | `FP-BR-DEV`, `FP-BR-PROD`, `FP-BR-DET`, `FP-BR-MIN` | Must preserve `SEM-INV-*` style invariants (ownership/cancel/quiescence/obligations). |
| `WS-OPT-EVIDENCE` | `franken_kernel`, `franken_evidence`, `franken_decision` integration surfaces | Optional for `FP-BR-DEV/DET`; off by default for `FP-BR-PROD/MIN` | Allowed only behind explicit feature flags; no implicit pull-in from default feature set. |
| `WS-TOOLING` | `conformance`, `frankenlab`, `cli`, native-only docs/scripts | Native/tooling lanes only | Must remain outside browser artifact closure and wasm profile manifests. |

### 10.3 Optionalization rules

1. Browser profiles are authoritative:
   - `wasm-browser-dev`
   - `wasm-browser-prod`
   - `wasm-browser-deterministic`
   - `wasm-browser-minimal`
2. Native-only surfaces remain hard-forbidden in wasm profiles (`cli`, `tls`,
   `sqlite`, `postgres`, `mysql`, `kafka`, `native-runtime`).
3. Optional evidence/policy crates are opt-in only; browser production defaults
   cannot depend on them transitively.
4. `WS-TOOLING` crates are validated in separate CI lanes and must not be
   required to compile browser runtime artifacts.

### 10.4 Implementation sequencing (smallest safe slices)

1. `SLICE-A` Manifest closure:
   - enforce target-gated native dependencies in root `Cargo.toml`;
   - verify all browser profiles resolve without tooling-only crates.
2. `SLICE-B` Module export fences:
   - keep platform-specific modules gated from wasm;
   - ensure required/adapter sets remain available under browser profiles.
3. `SLICE-C` Optional-evidence lane:
   - introduce explicit feature toggles for `WS-OPT-EVIDENCE` paths;
   - confirm default browser profiles exclude them.
4. `SLICE-D` CI and policy integration:
   - wire profile validation + dependency policy + size/perf gates as blocking.

### 10.5 Verification contract (for implementation beads)

Required evidence per slice:

1. Deterministic unit evidence for profile closure and feature gating behavior.
2. Browser-path integration evidence (at least one e2e or parity scenario) for
   any user-visible surface retained in `WS-CORE`.
3. Reproducible command bundle (use `rch exec -- ...` for cargo-heavy checks):
   ```bash
   rch exec -- cargo check -p asupersync --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --no-default-features --features wasm-browser-minimal
   rch exec -- cargo check -p asupersync --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --no-default-features --features wasm-browser-dev
   rch exec -- cargo check -p asupersync --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --no-default-features --features wasm-browser-prod
   rch exec -- cargo check -p asupersync --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --no-default-features --features wasm-browser-deterministic
   ```

### 10.6 Handoff to downstream bead

`asupersync-umelq.3.5` should consume this section as normative input for:

1. dependency minimization policy updates,
2. feature/profile closure enforcement,
3. regression gates preventing workspace-slice drift.
