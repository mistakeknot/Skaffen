//! Shutdown coordination for HTTP server lifecycle.
//!
//! This module provides [`ShutdownSignal`] for coordinating graceful server shutdown
//! with drain timeouts and phase tracking. It builds on the lower-level
//! [`ShutdownController`] by adding drain-phase
//! awareness and timeout semantics.
