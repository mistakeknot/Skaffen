//! Cancellation protocol oracle for verifying the cancellation invariant.
//!
//! This oracle verifies invariant #3: Cancellation is a protocol.
//! Tasks must transition through request → drain → finalize in a bounded way.
//!
//! Additionally, this oracle verifies **INV-CANCEL-PROPAGATES**:
//! When a region is cancelled, all its descendant regions also have cancel set.
//!
//! # The Protocol
//!
//! Valid cancellation transitions for a task:
//! ```text
//! Created/Running → CancelRequested → Cancelling → Finalizing → Completed(Cancelled)
//! ```
//!
//! Key properties:
//! - Cancellation is idempotent (repeated requests strengthen but don't break protocol)
//! - Mask deferral is bounded (eventually checkpoint must acknowledge)
//! - Cleanup budgets are respected
//! - Cancel propagates downward through the region tree
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use asupersync::lab::oracle::cancellation_protocol::CancellationProtocolOracle;
//!
//! let mut oracle = CancellationProtocolOracle::new();
//!
//! // Record events as they occur
//! oracle.on_region_create(region, parent);
//! oracle.on_task_create(task, region);
//! oracle.on_cancel_request(task, reason, time);
//! oracle.on_transition(task, from, to, time);
//! oracle.on_region_cancel(region, reason, time);
//!
//! // Verify invariants
//! oracle.check()?;
//! ```
