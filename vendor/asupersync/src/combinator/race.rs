//! Race combinator: run multiple operations, first wins.
//!
//! The race combinator runs multiple operations concurrently.
//! When the first one completes, all others are cancelled and drained.
//!
//! # Critical Invariant: Losers Are Drained
//!
//! Unlike other runtimes that abandon losers, asupersync always drains them:
//!
//! ```text
//! race(f1, f2):
//!   t1 ← spawn(f1)
//!   t2 ← spawn(f2)
//!   (winner, loser) ← select_first_complete(t1, t2)
//!   cancel(loser)
//!   await(loser)  // CRITICAL: drain the loser
//!   return winner.outcome
//! ```
//!
//! This ensures resources held by losers are properly released.
//!
//! # Algebraic Laws
//!
//! - Commutativity: `race(a, b) ≃ race(b, a)` (same winner set, different selection)
//! - Identity: `race(a, never) ≃ a` (never = future that never completes)
//! - Associativity: `race(race(a, b), c) ≃ race(a, race(b, c))`
//!
//! # Outcome Semantics
//!
//! The winner's outcome is returned directly. The loser is cancelled and
//! drained, but its outcome is not part of the race result (it's tracked
//! for invariant verification only).

/// The first future to complete wins.
///
/// Note: this macro is currently a placeholder and does **not** implement the
/// full asupersync race semantics (cancel + drain losers). Use the `Scope`
/// APIs (`Scope::race`, `Scope::race_all`) when racing spawned tasks.
///
/// # Basic Usage
///
/// ```ignore
/// let winner: Race2<A, B> = race!(fut_a, fut_b).await;
/// let winner: Race3<A, B, C> = race!(fut_a, fut_b, fut_c).await;
/// ```
///
/// # Biased Mode
///
/// Use `biased;` for left-to-right polling priority (useful for fallback patterns):
///
/// ```ignore
/// race! { biased;
///     check_cache(key),
///     query_database(key),
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Key Properties
///
/// 1. First future to return `Poll::Ready` is the winner
/// 2. All non-winning futures go through the cancellation protocol
/// 3. `race!` waits for all losers to complete before returning
/// 4. Losers complete with `Outcome::Cancelled(RaceLost)`
