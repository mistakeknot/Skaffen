# PLAN_TO_BUILD_ASUPERSYNC_IN_WASM_FOR_USE_IN_BROWSERS

## Document Header

- Version: `v4`
- Status: `Execution Blueprint`
- Scope: Browser/wasm adaptation of the most useful Asupersync subset with TS/React/Next developer product
- Intent: maximize correctness, adoption, and long-term architecture quality without stalling delivery

---

## 0. Program Charter

### 0.1 Mission

Build a browser-native Asupersync runtime product that preserves core semantic guarantees while becoming easy to integrate in modern frontend stacks.

### 0.2 Program outcomes

1. `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target compiles and runs a useful Asupersync subset.
2. Cancellation and structured concurrency semantics remain first-class and test-proven.
3. First-party JS/TS API is ergonomic and production-usable.
4. React and Next.js integration is straightforward and well-documented.
5. Deterministic replay/diagnostics become a flagship capability.

### 0.3 What success looks like

A frontend team can install `@asupersync/browser`, orchestrate complex async workflows with explicit cancellation trees, and replay concurrency incidents deterministically from production traces.

---

## 1. Non-Negotiable Constraints

1. Preserve Asupersync invariants:
   - structured ownership
   - cancel protocol (`request -> drain -> finalize`)
   - obligation accounting
   - region close => quiescence
2. Keep Tokio out of core runtime semantics.
3. Maintain deterministic mode reproducibility.
4. Keep capability boundaries explicit and auditable.
5. Do not ship a wasm artifact that weakens semantics for convenience.

### 1.1 ADR Governance Contract (WASM Program)

This program is governed by a formal ADR series. Any browser-facing semantic decision that can affect invariants, determinism, cancellation behavior, capability boundaries, or interoperability must land through this process.

Compatibility stance:

1. Browser adaptation is correctness-first, not compatibility-first.
2. Backwards compatibility is not guaranteed during this phase; semantic correctness is mandatory.
3. Any compatibility concession is allowed only when invariant-preserving and explicitly documented in an ADR with expiration criteria.

### 1.2 ADR Index (program baseline)

| ADR ID | Title | Status | Primary Owner | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `WASM-ADR-001` | Browser Semantic Contract Boundary | accepted | runtime-core | Defines what semantic behavior must remain identical to native mode |
| `WASM-ADR-002` | Platform Seam Taxonomy | accepted | runtime-core | Defines scheduler/time/io/authority seam model and responsibilities |
| `WASM-ADR-003` | Runtime Profile Model (`live-main-thread`, `live-worker`, `deterministic`) | accepted | runtime-core | Defines supported execution profiles and constraints |
| `WASM-ADR-004` | Capability Authority Envelope for Browser APIs | proposed | security/runtime | Defines explicit authority boundaries for fetch/storage/worker APIs |
| `WASM-ADR-005` | Deterministic Replay Artifact Contract for Browser Mode | proposed | trace/lab | Defines browser trace/replay schema guarantees |
| `WASM-ADR-006` | Deferred Native Surface Register Policy | accepted | architecture | Defines gate/defer criteria for native-only modules |
| `WASM-ADR-007` | Versioned WASM ABI and Break Policy | proposed | bindings/api | Defines ABI stability, versioning, and break handling rules |
| `WASM-ADR-008` | CI Gating and Evidence Promotion Rules | proposed | qa/ci | Defines evidence required for merge/release gates |
| `WASM-ADR-009` | Browser Threat Model and Abuse-Case Contract | proposed | security/runtime | Defines browser adversary classes, mandatory controls, and residual-risk policy |
| `WASM-ADR-010` | Browser Size/Perf Budget Contract | proposed | perf/release | Defines normative artifact/runtime budgets and escalation/waiver policy |

### 1.3 Explicitly Rejected Alternatives

These alternatives are intentionally rejected and must not be reintroduced without a superseding ADR:

1. Silent semantic weakening for browser convenience (for example: best-effort cancellation that can leak obligations).
2. Ambient authority wrappers around browser globals (`window`, `fetch`, timers) without explicit capability paths.
3. "Compile-only parity" acceptance criteria that skip deterministic replay/evidence requirements.
4. Ad-hoc per-feature policy exceptions without decision records and expiry.

### 1.4 ADR Decision Template (required for each browser-semantic decision)

```markdown
# WASM-ADR-XXX: <Title>

- Status: proposed | accepted | superseded | deprecated
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD
- Owners: <team/people>
- Related beads: <ids>
- Supersedes: <optional ADR IDs>

## Context
- What exact semantic/runtime problem is being solved?
- Which invariants are at risk if this is done incorrectly?
- Which alternatives were considered and why rejected?

## Decision
- Concrete decision statement (normative language: MUST/SHOULD/MAY).
- Exact surfaces affected (modules, feature flags, API boundaries).

## Allowed Tradeoffs
- Tradeoffs accepted for this decision (explicit, bounded, testable).

## Forbidden Compromises
- Explicitly disallowed shortcuts that would violate invariants.

## Invariant Impact Checklist
- [ ] Structured ownership preserved
- [ ] Cancel protocol preserved (`request -> drain -> finalize`)
- [ ] Loser-drain preserved
- [ ] No obligation leaks introduced
- [ ] Region-close quiescence preserved
- [ ] Deterministic profile reproducibility preserved
- [ ] Capability boundaries remain explicit

## Required Evidence
- Unit evidence:
- Conformance/e2e evidence:
- Replay/trace evidence:
- CI gate evidence:

## Rollout + Rollback
- Rollout plan:
- Rollback trigger conditions:
- Rollback execution path:

## Compatibility Statement
- Explicitly state compatibility impact and migration obligations.
```

### 1.5 Review Protocol and Sign-Off

Any ADR marked `accepted` requires:

1. One runtime-core approver.
2. One invariants/testing approver.
3. One integration/security approver when capability or boundary surfaces are touched.

Required review checklist:

1. Decision is scoped to named surfaces and is testable.
2. Rejected alternatives are explicit and technically justified.
3. Invariant impact checklist is complete with linked evidence.
4. CI/replay artifacts are reproducible with pinned commands.
5. Failure/rollback criteria are concrete and operational.

Promotion gates:

1. `proposed` -> `accepted`: requires evidence links + sign-off checklist complete.
2. `accepted` -> implemented rollout: requires bead links and CI pass on required lanes.
3. superseding/deprecating an ADR: must reference old/new IDs and migration obligations.

### 1.6 Cadence and Audit Rules

1. ADR index is reviewed weekly during browser program triage.
2. Every merged PR that changes browser semantic behavior must link an ADR ID.
3. Any semantic drift discovered in replay/conformance must file:
   - a corrective bead,
   - an ADR amendment (or superseding ADR),
   - and a root-cause note in the affected ADR.

## 3. Strategic Positioning and Product Thesis

## 3.1 Strategic thesis

Do not frame this as “Rust compiled to wasm.”

Frame it as:

**A frontend concurrency reliability runtime with deterministic replay and structural cancellation guarantees.**

## 3.2 Differentiation vectors

1. Structured concurrency in UI/client workflows.
2. Explicit cancellation protocol semantics.
3. Deterministic replay and invariant-aware diagnostics.
4. Capability-secure effect boundaries.
5. Unified Rust semantics and TS ergonomics.

## 3.3 Initial market wedge

Target teams with painful async complexity:

1. realtime dashboards
2. collaborative apps
3. route-heavy Next.js applications
4. SDK/platform teams shipping browser clients

### Option C: Hybrid staged split

1. immediate gating + seam abstraction in current crate
2. incremental extraction of stable core
3. complete split after parity is proven

## 4.2 Weighted decision matrix

### 6.1 Census Method (Deterministic, Reproducible)

The module census below is generated from crate surfaces declared in `src/lib.rs` and measured against live source using stable `rg` queries.

```bash
rg --no-filename '^pub mod [a-z_]+' src/lib.rs
rg -n "crate::<module>(::|;)" src -g '*.rs'              # fan-in
rg -o "crate::[a-z_]+" src/<module>{.rs,/} -g '*.rs'     # fan-out
rg -n "std::os::|libc|nix::|socket2|polling::|io_uring|kqueue|epoll|std::fs|std::net|signal" \
  src/<module>{.rs,/} -g '*.rs'                           # implicit OS assumptions
```

Snapshot timestamp: `2026-02-28`.

### 6.2 Public Module-by-Module Census (src/lib.rs surface)

Disposition semantics:

1. `required`: in browser-v1 semantic subset (or required to keep deterministic correctness workflow intact).
2. `optional`: not required for browser-v1 core path, but portable enough for later browser expansion.
3. `out-of-scope`: native-first surface gated out for browser-v1.

### 6.3 Internal Runtime Surface Census (non-lib.rs seams)

| Internal Surface | Browser v1 Disposition | Fan-in/Fan-out Role | Implicit OS Assumptions |
|---|---|---|---|
| `runtime/scheduler/three_lane.rs` | required (semantic core), with backend seam extraction | very high fan-in scheduler hub | currently assumes multi-worker parking/unparking and native thread model |
| `runtime/sharded_state.rs` | required | high fan-in state-mutation hub | lock-strategy assumptions; no hard OS syscall coupling required |
| `runtime/region_heap.rs` | required | medium fan-in allocator/state substrate | no direct syscall assumptions; deterministic handle semantics portable |
| `runtime/reactor/*` | out-of-scope for browser-v1 native path | high fan-out to IO stack | explicit epoll/kqueue/io_uring/FD token assumptions |
| `runtime/io_driver.rs` | out-of-scope for browser-v1 native path | hub between scheduler and reactor | evented FD readiness and OS reactor wake assumptions |
| `runtime/blocking_pool.rs` | out-of-scope for browser-v1 | medium fan-in for sync bridge | native thread creation/parking assumptions |
| `runtime/local.rs` | required (adapted) | low fan-in local-task pinning layer | currently thread-local storage assumptions; must map to browser worker identity model |
| `runtime/deadline_monitor.rs` | optional for v1 live profile, required for deterministic diagnostics profile | medium fan-in observability path | wall-clock fallback assumptions need browser monotonic timer substitution |

### 6.4 Workspace Crate Census

| Workspace Crate | Surface Kind | Browser v1 Disposition | Dependency Fan-in/Fan-out | Implicit OS Assumptions |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `asupersync` | primary runtime library surface | required | fan-in: highest; fan-out: depends on macros + FrankenSuite crates (+ feature-gated tooling) | mixed; strong native assumptions concentrated in gated modules |
| `asupersync-macros` | proc-macro compile-time surface | optional (ergonomics) | fan-in: consumed by `asupersync` when `proc-macros` enabled | none (compile-time syntax transformation only) |
| `asupersync-conformance` | test/conformance surface | optional for shipping runtime; required for CI quality gates | fan-in: validation-only; fan-out: serde/tempfile | light filesystem assumptions via test tooling |
| `franken-kernel` | shared type substrate | required (transitively used by runtime decision/evidence surfaces) | fan-in: `asupersync`, `franken-decision` | no OS coupling |
| `franken-evidence` | evidence ledger schema | required for evidence pipeline | fan-in: `asupersync`, `franken-decision` | no OS coupling |
| `franken-decision` | decision-contract runtime | required for scheduler decision-contract path | fan-in: `asupersync` | no OS coupling |
| `frankenlab` | deterministic harness CLI/package | optional for browser runtime artifact; required for replay/forensics workflows | fan-in: operator/testing workflows, depends on `asupersync` | mostly tooling assumptions (CLI/file outputs), not runtime-core OS dependency |

### 6.5 Browser-v1 Subset Summary (from census)

Required semantic set:

1. `types`, `error`, `cancel`, `obligation`, `record`
2. `cx`, `runtime` (semantic slice only), `time`
3. `channel`, `combinator`, `sync`, `stream`
4. `trace`, `plan`, `observability`, `util`, `bytes`

Out-of-scope native set (gated in browser-v1):

1. `net`, `fs`, `process`, `signal`, `server`
2. `io` (native reactor path), `http`, `grpc`, `tls`
3. `database`, `messaging`, `cli`

Critical implicit OS assumptions requiring explicit seam replacement before browser execution:

1. Reactor/event-loop assumptions (`epoll`, `kqueue`, `io_uring`, tokenized FD readiness).
2. Threading and parking assumptions (`Parker`, worker unparks, TLS task pinning).
3. Filesystem/process/signal assumptions in runtime-adjacent tooling and native integrations.

### 6.6 Deferred Surface Register (WASM-01.5)

Purpose:

1. Keep deferred browser-v1 surfaces explicit, owned, and testable.
2. Prevent deferrals from becoming untracked debt.
3. Define objective reintegration criteria tied to phase gates and evidence contracts.

Register rules:

1. Every deferred surface must have an owner role, rationale, and reintegration trigger.
2. Re-entry requires explicit gate evidence and deterministic repro artifacts.
3. Scope changes must update this register and linked bead dependencies in the same change set.

| Register ID | Deferred surface | Current disposition | Deferred rationale | Reintegration prerequisites | Reintegration acceptance evidence | Risk if deferred too long | Owner role |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `DSR-001` | `runtime/reactor/*` + `runtime/io_driver.rs` (native FD readiness path) | Deferred from browser-v1 runtime path | Browser profile does not expose portable FD reactor semantics equivalent to epoll/kqueue/io_uring invariants | Browser event backend + capability adapters (`WASM-04` + `WASM-06`) stable; parity harness for readiness/cancel edges | Deterministic L1/L2 parity suite with cancel/drain equivalence and replayable traces (`PG-5` gate) | Ad-hoc IO semantics may drift from cancellation/obligation protocol guarantees | Runtime backend owner |
| `DSR-002` | `runtime/blocking_pool.rs` | Deferred from browser-v1 execution profile | Browser baseline lacks native thread model assumptions used by blocking pool | Worker/offload model contract defined for browser profile; explicit authority + backpressure policy | Load/stress evidence showing no obligation leaks or quiescence regressions under offload pressure (`PG-5`/`PG-6`) | Hidden starvation and budget violations if reintroduced without model parity | Runtime + perf owner |
| `DSR-003` | Native network stack (`net`, `http`, `grpc`, `tls`) | Deferred for browser-v1 | Existing stack assumes socket/TLS semantics outside browser capability envelope | Browser IO capsules and authority envelopes complete; ABI surface stable (`WASM-06` + `WASM-07`) | L1/L2 integration suites for browser transport semantics; threat-model controls verified (`PG-5` + `PG-8`) | Fragmented API promises and security boundary confusion for users | IO/security owner |
| `DSR-004` | Native integration modules (`fs`, `process`, `signal`, `server`) | Deferred for browser-v1 | Platform mismatch with browser sandbox and host constraints | Clear browser-safe substitutes or explicit non-goal retention with migration guidance | Docs + conformance evidence showing no ambient-authority fallback introduced (`PG-8`) | Documentation drift and accidental unsupported-surface adoption | Product/docs owner |
| `DSR-005` | Data/client integrations (`database`, `messaging`) | Deferred for browser-v1 runtime | Current implementations are native-first and not browser capability-safe by default | Capability-safe bridge design + threat model + profile closure checks completed | Adversarial/security tests plus profile manifest closure reports (`PG-8`) | Silent capability expansion or insecure transport assumptions | Security + integration owner |
| `DSR-006` | CLI/tooling surface (`cli`, portions of `conformance`, file-oriented replay flows) | Deferred from browser artifact, retained in tooling lane | Browser package should not inherit host tooling assumptions | Browser diagnostics API contract complete (`WASM-11`) and artifact schema stable (`WASM-10`) | Replay/diagnostics parity evidence with schema validation and reproducible command bundles (`PG-7`) | Divergent diagnostics between browser and tooling ecosystems | Observability/tooling owner |
| `DSR-007` | Optional `frankenlab` packaging for browser distribution | Deferred for runtime package, retained for test/forensics workflows | Runtime artifact should stay lean while preserving deterministic verification path | Packaging split stable (`runtime` vs `forensics` artifacts) and CI matrix enforces both lanes | CI evidence that browser runtime and forensic toolchain remain version-compatible (`PG-8`) | Loss of deterministic incident triage path if coupling breaks | QA/forensics owner |

Reintegration workflow (mandatory):

1. Open or link a reintegration bead referencing `DSR-*`.
2. Record prerequisites as explicit checklist items with owners.
3. Land implementation with L0+L1 (or higher) deterministic evidence.
4. Attach replay commands and artifact pointers required by gate policy.
5. Update register row state and remove deferral only after gate promotion succeeds.

Cross-bead linkage:

1. `asupersync-umelq.16.2` (quickstart/migration docs) depends on this register to accurately present deferred vs supported browser surfaces.
2. `asupersync-umelq.3.*` profile-closure work must enforce register constraints in CI policy checks.

## 7. Invariant Preservation Program

## 7.1 Invariant mapping

| Invariant | Browser implementation plan | Validation method |
|---|---|---|
| No orphan tasks | preserve region-owned task graph and closure checks | region oracle + leak oracle |
| Region close => quiescence | identical region close state machine | quiescence oracle |
| Cancel protocol | identical phase machine with JS capsule bridge | phase transition trace tests |
| Losers drained | preserve race loser-drain semantics | race drain suite |
| No obligation leaks | preserve obligation table lifecycle | obligation leak oracle |
| Determinism (mode) | virtual clock + deterministic tick scheduler | trace fingerprint parity tests |

## 7.2 Proof obligation template (mandatory per PR)

Each PR touching semantic paths must document:

1. invariants impacted
2. tests/oracles proving preservation
3. trace events proving expected transitions
4. residual risk and follow-up tasks

## 7.3 Oracle parity matrix

Run both native deterministic and wasm deterministic modes against same scenario corpus and compare:

1. terminal outcome class
2. leak counts
3. quiescence status
4. trace equivalence fingerprint

---

## 8. Browser Runtime Engine Design

## 8.1 Runtime profiles

1. `live-main-thread`
2. `live-worker`
3. `deterministic`

## 8.2 Scheduler algorithm

Per tick:

1. consume cancel-lane budget slice
2. consume timed-lane due slice
3. consume ready-lane slice
4. run finalize/drain micro-pass
5. emit telemetry snapshot as configured
6. schedule next tick if work remains

## 8.3 Wake strategy

1. microtask wake for low latency
2. macrotask fallback to avoid starvation and ensure yielding

1. Streams API bridges
2. WebTransport adapter
3. Service Worker channel adapter

## 10. Build and Dependency Surgery Plan

## 10.1 Dependency closure actions

1. move `signal-hook` behind non-wasm target cfg
2. move `nix`, `libc`, `socket2`, `polling` out of wasm closure
3. move `tempfile` out of unconditional runtime closure
4. add wasm deps:
   - `wasm-bindgen`
   - `js-sys`
   - `web-sys`
   - `wasm-bindgen-futures`
5. resolve direct `tokio` dependency policy and closure impact

## 10.2 Feature profile design

Canonical browser build profiles (normative):

| Profile ID | Profile name | Intended use | Required features | Allowed optional features | Forbidden features/surfaces | Promotion gate |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `FP-BR-DEV` | `wasm-browser-dev` | local dev, fast iteration, diagnostics | `wasm-runtime`, `browser-io` | `browser-trace`, `tracing-integration`, `test-internals` | `native-runtime`, `cli`, `tls`, `sqlite`, `postgres`, `mysql`, `kafka`, any tokio-backed surface | must compile on `wasm32-unknown-unknown` and pass browser smoke suite |
| `FP-BR-PROD` | `wasm-browser-prod` | production browser package | `wasm-runtime`, `browser-io` | `browser-trace` (bounded), `trace-compression` | `test-internals`, `native-runtime`, `cli`, database/network-native stacks, any tokio-backed surface | size/perf/security gates + invariant parity suite green |
| `FP-BR-DET` | `wasm-browser-deterministic` | replay, incident forensics, CI deterministic checks | `wasm-runtime`, `deterministic-mode`, `browser-trace` | `trace-compression` | `native-runtime`, ambient-time shortcuts, non-deterministic entropy/time sources without capture hooks | deterministic replay matrix green for pinned traces |
| `FP-BR-MIN` | `wasm-browser-minimal` | minimal embed footprint | `wasm-runtime` | none by default | `browser-io`, `browser-trace`, all non-essential integrations | compiles clean and passes core scheduler/cancel invariants |

Profile normalization rules:

1. Browser targets MUST select exactly one `FP-BR-*` canonical profile.
2. `FP-BR-PROD` is the default release profile; all others are explicit opt-in.
3. Any new browser feature must declare:
   - which `FP-BR-*` profiles permit it,
   - expected size/perf impact,
   - deterministic-mode impact (`FP-BR-DET`).
4. Any profile deviation requires ADR reference and expiration criteria.

Implementation status (bead `asupersync-umelq.3.4`): canonical profile feature
aliases are declared in `Cargo.toml`, and the dependency policy scanner now
uses `FP-BR-DEV/PROD/DET/MIN` profile IDs directly.

## 10.3 Feature compatibility enforcement

| Feature/surface | Native target | wasm browser target | Enforcement mode |
|---|---|---|---|
| `native-runtime` | allowed | forbidden | compile-time `cfg` + compile-fail tests |
| `wasm-runtime` | optional | required | profile validator + CI gate |
| `browser-io` | no-op/forbidden | allowed in `FP-BR-DEV/PROD` | feature-compat matrix tests |
| `deterministic-mode` | allowed | required for `FP-BR-DET` | deterministic lane gate |
| `browser-trace` | optional | required for `FP-BR-DET`; optional bounded for PROD | artifact schema + replay gates |
| `cli` | allowed | forbidden | target-gated manifest + compile-fail tests |
| `tls/sqlite/postgres/mysql/kafka` | allowed by profile | forbidden for browser profiles | manifest policy checks |
| tokio-backed surface | forbidden in core semantics | forbidden | dependency closure audit + deny-list |

Enforcement implementation requirements:

1. Add profile validation checks that fail build on illegal feature combinations.
2. Keep a committed compatibility matrix artifact and diff it in CI.
3. Require per-profile reproducible commands in gate docs (all heavy checks run via `rch exec -- ...`).

## 11. JS/TS API Product Design

## 11.1 API principles

1. explicit lifecycle
2. typed outcomes
3. explicit cancellation
4. no ambient global runtime by default

## 11.2 Runtime API sketch

```ts
export type RuntimeMode = "live" | "deterministic";

export interface RuntimeOptions {
  mode?: RuntimeMode;
  seed?: number;
  pollBudget?: number;
  worker?: "main" | "dedicated";
  trace?: { enabled: boolean; capacity?: number };
}

export interface RuntimeHandle {
  close(): Promise<void>;
  createScope(label?: string): ScopeHandle;
  createCancelToken(reason?: string): CancelTokenHandle;
  io: BrowserIo;

}
```

## 11.3 Outcome contract

---

## 15. Security and Capability Hardening

## 15.1 Threat model scope and assumptions (WASM-13 baseline)

Protected assets:

1. capability boundaries (`Cx`-mediated authority and scoped handles),
2. cancellation and obligation state integrity (no forged completion, no silent leak),
3. deterministic trace/replay artifacts (confidentiality + integrity + provenance),
4. browser package integrity (wasm/js bundle authenticity),
5. host-app boundary correctness (worker messaging, storage, and bridge surfaces).

Adversary classes:

1. malicious same-origin application code attempting capability escalation,
2. compromised dependency/supply-chain artifact in the browser bundle path,
3. hostile input stream (malformed payloads, replay artifacts, protocol abuse),
4. operator error (misconfigured capability policy, overbroad telemetry, unsafe defaults).

Assumptions:

1. Browser sandbox primitives hold at platform baseline (no speculative sandbox escape modeled here).
2. TLS termination and CDN delivery are external controls; this model focuses on runtime-layer fail-closed behavior when those controls degrade.
3. Native-only surfaces remain gated out of browser profiles as defined by feature-profile policy.

## 15.2 Browser abuse-case matrix

| Threat vector | Representative abuse case | Impact class | Required mitigation | Detection and evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Capability escalation | Caller forges or reuses stale wasm handle to access unauthorized operation | R0-critical | Generation-tagged handle registry; fail-closed lookup; scope-bound capability checks on every boundary call | Structured `capability_denied` events with handle generation mismatch metadata |
| API abuse / cancellation storms | Untrusted caller floods cancel requests to degrade progress or force inconsistent cleanup | R0-critical | Idempotent cancel protocol, bounded drain budget policy, loser-drain enforcement, starvation/fairness guards | Cancel-pressure counters + fairness certificates + replayable seed traces |
| Supply-chain compromise | Tampered wasm/js artifact inserted in build/distribution path | R0-critical | Provenance attestation, checksum/signature verification, release-manifest pinning, deterministic build metadata | Artifact integrity report with hash/provenance tuple per release candidate |
| Replay artifact leakage | Trace bundle exposes sensitive payload/context beyond intended diagnostic scope | R1-high | Redaction/minimization policy, explicit field allowlist, encrypted storage path where required | Redaction audit report + policy check outputs linked to trace artifact IDs |
| Host bridge confusion | `postMessage`/worker channel mixes trusted and untrusted command envelopes | R1-high | Origin/session binding, typed envelope schema validation, default-deny command routing | Bridge contract violation logs with rejected envelope snapshots |
| Resource exhaustion | Crafted workload causes pathological allocation or event-loop monopolization | R1-high | Runtime budget enforcement (poll/cost/deadline), bounded queue policies, backpressure with explicit failure | Size/perf gate artifacts + queue pressure telemetry + deterministic repro scripts |
| Trace tampering | Adversary edits replay artifact to hide root cause or forge outcomes | R1-high | Artifact hash chain + schema/version validation + optional signed envelope | Trace verification output (`verify` report + mismatch pointers) |

## 15.3 Security controls contract

Mandatory controls for browser-v1 promotion:

1. Default-deny capability surface:
   - no ambient access to `fetch`, timers, storage, crypto, or worker channels without explicit capsule wiring,
   - every externally reachable operation must declare required capability class.
2. Handle safety:
   - generation-protected handle IDs,
   - strict invalidation on region close/finalization,
   - stale handle use is a hard error, never a best-effort no-op.
3. Supply-chain integrity:
   - reproducible artifact metadata,
   - hash/provenance tuple persisted with release evidence,
   - promotion blocked on missing integrity envelope.
4. Telemetry hygiene:
   - trace schema field allowlist,
   - redaction markers for sensitive fields,
   - explicit retention and export policy tied to profile.
5. Host boundary hardening:
   - typed message envelopes,
   - origin/session binding for bridge channels,
   - reject-then-log policy for unknown commands.

## 15.4 Adversarial test obligations

Required deterministic security tests:

1. Stale/forged handle misuse matrix (L0 + L1).
2. Capability boundary bypass attempts across adapter APIs (L0 + L1).
3. Cancellation abuse stress scenarios with fairness and obligation-leak assertions (L1 + L2).
4. Malformed and tampered trace import scenarios (L0 + L3).
5. Bridge-envelope spoofing/replay tests for worker and host integration surfaces (L1 + L2).

Required gate evidence:

1. deterministic scenario IDs and seeds,
2. structured logs with threat ID, mitigation verdict, and replay pointers,
3. reproducible command bundle (cargo-heavy steps via `rch exec -- ...`),
4. residual-risk delta summary versus previous green baseline.

## 15.5 Residual risk register policy

1. Every unresolved `R0-critical` item blocks promotion immediately.
2. `R1-high` items require explicit owner, mitigation plan, and expiry date before release candidate promotion.
3. Temporary waiver requires ADR entry with:
   - concrete risk statement,
   - compensating controls,
   - deterministic detection signal,
   - rollback trigger.
4. Security register review cadence:
   - weekly during active implementation,
   - mandatory at each phase gate (`PG-*`) and before GA cut.

---

## 16. Performance and Size Engineering

## 16.1 Budget contract (WASM-12 baseline)

All budgets are normative for browser-v1 promotion (`PG-8` and `PG-9` gates) unless an explicit waiver ADR is approved.

Assumed measurement baseline (for comparability, not for exclusivity):

1. Browser: Chromium stable channel on Linux x86_64.
2. Device class: 4 vCPU / 16 GB RAM baseline runner.
3. Network model: local assets, warm HTTP cache unless scenario states "cold start".
4. Runtime profile under test: `FP-BR-PROD` unless otherwise stated.
5. Runs per scenario: minimum 30 samples with p50/p95/p99 captured.

| Budget metric | `core-min` | `core-trace` | `full-dev` | Gate class |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Compressed wasm size (gzip) | <= 220 KiB | <= 340 KiB | <= 520 KiB | hard fail |
| Raw wasm size | <= 700 KiB | <= 1.05 MiB | <= 1.60 MiB | hard fail |
| Init latency p95 (module load + instantiate + runtime bootstrap) | <= 45 ms | <= 60 ms | <= 90 ms | hard fail |
| Scheduler turn overhead p95 | <= 250 us | <= 275 us | <= 325 us | hard fail |
| Cancellation response latency p95 (`request -> observed at checkpoint`) | <= 8 ms | <= 10 ms | <= 14 ms | hard fail |
| Steady-state memory overhead (runtime core, no app payload) | <= 24 MiB | <= 30 MiB | <= 40 MiB | hard fail |
| Trace-enabled overhead vs `core-min` p95 (equal scenario) | n/a | <= +12% | <= +18% | hard fail |

Notes:

1. p99 values must not exceed `1.8x` p95 for the same metric; otherwise classify as instability regression.
2. Any single-metric breach in two consecutive CI runs blocks promotion.
3. Budget values are intentionally strict to prevent late-stage footprint creep in browser integrations.

## 16.2 Tiered packaging contract

1. `core-min`: invariant-safe runtime kernel for constrained browser environments; no default tracing payload.
2. `core-trace`: adds deterministic trace/replay hooks required for incident forensics and parity workflows.
3. `full-dev`: developer-focused package with richer diagnostics, bounded to keep local iteration practical.

Each tier must publish:

1. feature profile manifest (`required`, `optional`, `forbidden`),
2. measured size tuple (`raw`, `gzip`, `brotli` when available),
3. runtime budget report (`init`, `scheduler`, `cancel`, `memory`),
4. reproducible command bundle and artifact pointers.

## 16.3 CI gates and regression policy

All compute-heavy Rust checks must run through `rch`.

Required CI checks for WASM-12:

1. Size gate:
   - Build each tier artifact and compute `raw + gzip` sizes.
   - Fail immediately when any hard budget is exceeded.
2. Perf smoke gate:
   - Run deterministic browser perf scenarios (scheduler turn, cancel response, init).
   - Store p50/p95/p99 and scenario metadata.
3. Regression gate:
   - Compare against last green baseline for same tier/profile.
   - Fail on >5% regression for latency/memory metrics unless an approved waiver exists.
4. Artifact gate:
   - Upload structured report with scenario ID, seed/config pointers, runner metadata, and repro commands.
   - Missing artifact fields are a gate failure (not a warning).

Escalation policy:

1. First breach: open blocker bead under `WASM-12`, attach failing artifacts, and pin owner.
2. Second consecutive breach: freeze dependent promotions (`PG-8+`) until resolved.
3. Waiver path: ADR with explicit expiry date, risk owner, and rollback condition.

## 16.4 Optimization pipeline contract (compiler flags + wasm-opt + variants)

Artifact variants (must be published for each promoted commit):

| Variant ID | Cargo profile + feature profile | Optimization intent | `wasm-opt` policy | Required outputs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `AV-DEV` | `--profile dev` + `FP-BR-DEV` | Fast local iteration with good diagnostics | `-O1 --debuginfo` | debug symbols, size/perf snapshot, deterministic smoke trace |
| `AV-CANARY` | `--profile release` + `FP-BR-PROD` + bounded trace | Production-like confidence before stable | `-O2` | canary wasm/js bundle, baseline delta report, replay compatibility verdict |
| `AV-REL-SIZE` | `--profile release` + `FP-BR-PROD` | Minimize transfer + cold-start overhead | `-Oz` | release-size bundle, budget verdict table, migration notes |
| `AV-REL-SPEED` | `--profile release` + `FP-BR-PROD` | Maximize steady-state runtime performance | `-O3` | release-speed bundle, scheduler/cancel perf report, deterministic parity verdict |

Compiler/profile guardrails:

1. Release-class variants (`AV-CANARY`, `AV-REL-*`) must pin codegen settings and include them in artifact metadata:
   - `lto` mode,
   - `codegen-units`,
   - panic strategy,
   - target triple and rustc version.
2. Any change to release-class compiler settings requires:
   - explicit baseline before/after comparison,
   - rollback trigger entry (`RB-*`),
   - and ADR reference when tradeoffs alter operational posture.
3. Optimization changes are invalid unless deterministic parity evidence remains green for retained invariants.

`wasm-opt` pass policy:

1. Allowed baseline levels:
   - `AV-DEV`: `-O1 --debuginfo`
   - `AV-CANARY`: `-O2`
   - `AV-REL-SIZE`: `-Oz`
   - `AV-REL-SPEED`: `-O3`
2. Any custom pass pipeline beyond baseline level must be declared in a committed manifest and diffed in CI.
3. Passes that alter observable boundary semantics (ABI shape, exported symbol set, deterministic trace contract) require explicit compatibility review and gate approval.

Build/repro command contract:

1. Cargo-heavy steps must run through `rch`:
   - `rch exec -- cargo build -p asupersync --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --profile <profile> --no-default-features --features <feature-set>`
2. Post-build optimization command must be artifactized:
   - `wasm-opt <in.wasm> -o <out.wasm> <level-or-pass-set>`
3. Every variant publish must include exact commands, tool versions, and artifact hash tuple (`raw`, `gzip`, optional `brotli`).

## 16.5 Variant promotion and rollback policy

1. Promotion sequence:
   - `AV-DEV` -> `AV-CANARY` -> (`AV-REL-SIZE` and/or `AV-REL-SPEED`) -> channel promotion.
2. Promotion blockers:
   - any hard budget failure,
   - deterministic parity failure,
   - ABI/export drift without approved compatibility transition.
3. Variant selection rule for stable channel:
   - choose the lowest-cost variant that satisfies all hard gates and required SLO targets.
4. Rollback trigger conditions:
   - >5% regression in key latency/memory metrics on two consecutive runs,
   - size budget breach,
   - replay instability or cancellation invariant regression.
5. Rollback action:
   - revert to last known-green variant manifest and reissue artifact set with updated incident note.

## 16.6 Evidence schema requirements

Every WASM-12 gate report must include:

1. `profile_id`, `variant_id`, and package tier,
2. commit SHA + data hash,
3. deterministic scenario IDs and seeds,
4. metric set with p50/p95/p99 and threshold verdict,
5. baseline delta percentages,
6. direct rerun commands (including `rch exec -- ...` wrappers for cargo workloads),
7. compiler + `wasm-opt` configuration fingerprints.

## 17. Testing and Quality Gates

## 17.1 Rust-side matrix

1. native build/test
2. wasm build/test
3. clippy across active profiles
4. deterministic parity tests between native and wasm deterministic modes

## 17.2 JS/TS-side matrix

1. unit tests
2. browser integration tests (Playwright)
3. React hook lifecycle tests
4. Next integration e2e tests

## 17.3 Invariant gate suite

1. no orphan tasks
2. no obligation leaks
3. region-close quiescence
4. loser-drain correctness
5. deterministic trace fingerprint stability

## 17.4 Verification taxonomy (WASM-17 test fabric baseline)

Test layers:

1. `L0-unit`: deterministic unit tests for one semantic unit (single module/state machine)
2. `L1-integration`: cross-module runtime flow tests (scheduler + cancel + obligation + adapters)
3. `L2-e2e`: browser user-path tests (vanilla, React, Next) with artifact capture
4. `L3-replay`: deterministic replay assertions from captured traces and seeded scenario fixtures

Risk tiers:

1. `R0-critical`: cancellation, quiescence, obligation closure, authority boundaries
2. `R1-high`: scheduler fairness, timer semantics, io capsule lifecycle, trace integrity
3. `R2-medium`: framework binding correctness, packaging boundaries, docs-linked UX flows

Rule: every retained browser feature/invariant must map to at least one `L0-unit` test and one higher-level test (`L1/L2/L3`).

## 17.6 Coverage targets and pass/fail thresholds

Coverage targets (minimum; per PR touching mapped surface):

1. `R0-critical` rows: line >= 92%, branch >= 88%, mutation kill >= 80%
2. `R1-high` rows: line >= 88%, branch >= 82%, mutation kill >= 70%
3. `R2-medium` rows: line >= 80%, branch >= 72%
4. Every traceability row must have at least one `L0-unit` and one higher-layer test reference in CI artifacts.

Pass/fail gates:

1. Any missing `L0-unit` or missing higher-layer mapping for a touched `WVT-*` row fails CI.
2. Any `R0-critical` scenario without replay pointer (`RP-*`) fails CI.
3. Deterministic parity suites must match outcome class and fingerprint class for required rows.
4. Structured log validation must confirm required fields: `trace_id`, `scenario_id`, `seed`, `runtime_profile`, `artifact_uri`, `outcome_class`.

## 17.7 Critical scenario catalog (must stay replayable)

1. `RP-CANCEL-001`: cancel during reserve before commit (no data loss, no leak)
2. `RP-CANCEL-002`: parent cancel fanout with mixed child phases (all children drained/finalized)
3. `RP-RACE-001`: race winner commit with loser drain completion guarantee
4. `RP-OBL-001`: permit/ack/lease closure under timeout and explicit user cancel
5. `RP-QUIESCE-001`: region close under concurrent finalizers reaches quiescence
6. `RP-DET-001`: same seed and profile produce equivalent fingerprint class
7. `RP-FETCH-001`: fetch abort bridge preserves cancel reason mapping and cleanup
8. `RP-HANDLE-001`: stale handle and forged id paths rejected with deterministic errors
9. `RP-TRACE-001`: trace export/import roundtrip preserves replay determinism

## 17.8 Ownership and maintenance cadence

Ownership roles:

1. Runtime backend owner: `WVT-001/002/007`
2. Cancellation/runtime owner: `WVT-003`
3. Combinator owner: `WVT-004`
4. Obligation owner: `WVT-005`
5. Determinism owner: `WVT-006`
6. Browser IO owner: `WVT-009/010`
7. Bindings owner: `WVT-011`
8. Replay/observability owner: `WVT-012`
9. Framework owner: `WVT-013/014`

Cadence:

1. On every PR: update touched `WVT-*` mappings and attach artifact links.
2. Weekly: review coverage deltas and stale replay fixtures.
3. Per milestone gate: full matrix audit across native/wasm and framework lanes.
4. Before GA: zero unmapped retained features/invariants, zero stale `RP-*` pointers.

## 19. Phase Plan with Entry/Exit Gates

### 19.1 Phase-gate operating contract

1. Gates are ordered and monotonic (`PG-0` through `PG-9`); no skipping and no parallel promotion.
2. A gate is only promotable when all exit evidence links are present and replayable.
3. Any kill criterion is a stop-the-line event: freeze forward work on affected tracks until disposition is documented.
4. Every rollback must pin:
   - rollback trigger ID,
   - last known-good gate,
   - exact revert scope (PRs/beads),
   - deterministic repro bundle (`RP-*`, `EV-*`).
5. Promotion authority is triad approval: runtime owner + invariants/testing owner + integration/security owner (for capability/interop gates).

### 19.2 Gate matrix: entry, exit, kill, rollback

| Gate | Phase | Entry | Exit | Kill criteria (stop-the-line) | Rollback trigger and target |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `PG-0` | Phase 0: Baseline and ADR lock | Baseline inventory and blocker scan complete | wasm CI lane active; blocker report stable; ADR baseline approved | Any retained invariant lacks owning ADR; blocker evidence non-reproducible | `RB-0A`: ADR contradiction or missing owner -> rollback to pre-ADR-lock state and re-run baseline inventory |
| `PG-1` | Phase 1: Dependency closure repair | `PG-0` accepted | wasm profile reaches crate compilation stage | wasm compile blocked by unresolved native dependency chain for 2 consecutive milestone cycles | `RB-1A`: closure regression -> revert offending dependency/profile changes to last green `PG-0/1` commit set |
| `PG-2` | Phase 2: Surface gating | `PG-1` accepted | wasm path excludes native-only surfaces cleanly | Any required browser-v1 surface removed without deferred-register entry; cfg fences permit forbidden native path in wasm profile | `RB-2A`: surface regression -> revert fence/export edits to last green `PG-1` and regenerate census |
| `PG-3` | Phase 3: Semantic seam extraction | `PG-2` accepted | backend interfaces wired; native parity preserved | Native parity regressions on retained invariants (`WVT-*`) or lock-order violations introduced by seam wiring | `RB-3A`: seam parity break -> rollback seam extraction PR batch to last green `PG-2` |
| `PG-4` | Phase 4: Browser scheduler/time alpha | `PG-3` accepted | scheduler and timer suites pass in browser harness | Deterministic profile replay mismatch on identical seed; starvation/fairness regression above agreed threshold in scheduler suites | `RB-4A`: scheduler drift -> rollback browser scheduler/time backend to last green `PG-3` traits-only state |
| `PG-5` | Phase 5: Browser I/O alpha | `PG-4` accepted | fetch/websocket cancel semantics verified | Obligation leaks, loser-drain failures, or capability-boundary violations in browser I/O suites | `RB-5A`: I/O semantic violation -> rollback adapter implementation while retaining seam interfaces |
| `PG-6` | Phase 6: Bindings and TS alpha | `PG-5` accepted | strict TS integration green | ABI break without version bump/migration note; ownership/lifecycle mismatch across JS<->WASM boundary | `RB-6A`: binding contract break -> rollback binding layer to last green ABI schema version |
| `PG-7` | Phase 7: React/Next beta | `PG-6` accepted | example apps and framework e2e suites green | Framework integration hides cancellation/ownership semantics or introduces nondeterministic failure clusters | `RB-7A`: framework semantic mismatch -> rollback framework adapters/hooks to last green TS core |
| `PG-8` | Phase 8: Replay beta | `PG-7` accepted | deterministic reproduction of real trace bug demonstrated | Replay pipeline cannot reproduce captured incidents from pinned artifact set | `RB-8A`: replay non-reproducible -> rollback trace/replay schema changes to last green `PG-7` |
| `PG-9` | Phase 9: Hardening + GA | `PG-8` accepted | GA criteria satisfied across correctness, perf/size, security, release ops | Any red gate in GA board: invariant, security, perf/size budget, or release automation | `RB-9A`: GA blocker -> rollback release candidate to last green `PG-8` and reopen blocked bead cluster |

### 19.3 Rollback execution protocol (mandatory)

1. Incident declaration:
   - issue ID `RB-*` opened with gate ID and trigger statement.
2. Freeze scope:
   - pause promotions on affected track until rollback decision lands.
3. Reproduce deterministically:
   - attach `rch exec -- cargo check --all-targets` / `rch exec -- cargo test` / relevant replay command output as artifact links.
4. Execute rollback:
   - revert only the scoped PR/bead set tied to the trigger; do not widen blast radius without a second approval.
5. Verify rollback target:
   - rerun required gate evidence and confirm return to last known-green state.
6. Resume conditions:
   - corrective bead created, owner assigned, and prevention check added to gate evidence.

## 22. Risk Register

### 22.1 Owner-assigned risk control table

| Risk ID | Risk | Trigger signal | Impact | Mitigation owner | Mitigation controls | Verification evidence | Review cadence | Escalation trigger |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `R-01` | Dependency regression | New native dependency enters wasm profile closure checks | wasm build break, release delay | Build/Dependency owner | dependency CI gate, feature-profile closure checks, forbidden-dep policy checks | `cargo tree` diff artifact, wasm compile evidence bundle | Every PR + weekly triage | 2 consecutive red wasm lane runs |
| `R-02` | Semantic drift | Native vs browser parity mismatch on retained invariants | cancellation/quiescence correctness loss | Runtime invariants owner | `WVT-*` parity matrix, oracle suites, seam contract checks | parity report with reproducible seed/trace IDs | Every milestone gate | Any invariant gate failure (`PG-3` to `PG-9`) |
| `R-03` | Scheduler fairness/jank regression | Queue starvation or event-loop budget overruns | degraded UX, latent task completion | Browser scheduler owner | fairness budget checks, yield discipline, worker-offload policy | scheduler benchmark + determinism run artifacts | Weekly + perf gate | p95/p99 fairness budget miss in 2 runs |
| `R-04` | Binding lifecycle unsoundness | JS<->WASM ownership mismatch, leaked handles, stale refs | correctness and stability regressions | Bindings/API owner | ABI versioning policy, handle-generation checks, lifecycle conformance tests | ABI contract tests + leak/lifecycle reports | Every PR touching bindings | Any high-severity binding conformance failure |
| `R-05` | Size/perf budget creep | Bundle/runtime metrics exceed defined budgets | adoption friction, runtime sluggishness | Perf/Release owner | budget thresholds, tiered package outputs, CI regression gates | size/perf trend report with baseline deltas | Weekly + release checkpoint | 10% budget overrun without approved waiver ADR |
| `R-06` | Security/capability boundary breach | Implicit authority path or forged capability handle | misuse/exfiltration risk | Security/Capability owner | default-deny capsules, capability scope audits, fuzz/adversarial tests | security gate report + red-team scenario logs | Weekly security review | any unmitigated high-severity security finding |
| `R-07` | Replay non-determinism | Same trace seed reproduces divergent outcomes | incident forensics become untrusted | Trace/Replay owner | trace schema contract tests, replay-delta verifier, artifact immutability checks | replay reproducibility ledger (`RP-*`) | Every replay change + weekly | any non-reproducible critical incident replay |
| `R-08` | Coordination drift between beads and gates | Bead status, gate status, and evidence links diverge | blocked delivery and audit gaps | Program architecture owner | bead-thread discipline, gate board audits, ownership rebalancing | weekly audit report linking beads->gates->evidence | Weekly triage + bi-weekly milestone | orphaned high-priority bead for >1 milestone |

### 22.2 Review rhythm and governance protocol

1. Weekly risk review:
   - validate trigger signals, owner status, and mitigation progress for all `R-*`.
2. Bi-weekly milestone board:
   - map open risks to `PG-*` promotion decisions and capture waivers/blocks explicitly.
3. PR-time obligation:
   - any PR touching risky surfaces must reference affected `R-*` rows and updated evidence.
4. Escalation SLA:
   - escalation triggers must be acknowledged by the mitigation owner within one working day.

### 22.3 Risk closure criteria

1. A risk row can be marked mitigated only when:
   - trigger signal is controlled,
   - verification evidence is green for two consecutive review cycles,
   - and residual risk is documented with explicit owner acceptance.
2. No `R-*` in escalated state is allowed at `PG-9` promotion.

## 26. Strategic Why

This plan intentionally pairs deep semantic rigor with aggressive productization.

- Rigor without adoption yields an elegant but unused runtime.
- Adoption without rigor yields a popular but fragile abstraction.

The objective is both: **correctness you can trust** and **developer experience teams will actually adopt**.
