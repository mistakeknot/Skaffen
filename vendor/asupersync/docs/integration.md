# Integration Documentation: Architecture, API, Tutorials

This document consolidates the integration-facing documentation for Asupersync:
architecture overview, API reference orientation, and practical tutorials. It is
written for developers integrating the runtime or the RaptorQ stack into other
systems (including fastapi_rust).

## Quick Start (minimal)

```ignore
use asupersync::{Cx, Outcome};
use asupersync::proc_macros::scope;
use asupersync::runtime::RuntimeBuilder;

fn main() -> Result<(), asupersync::Error> {
    let rt = RuntimeBuilder::current_thread().build()?;

    rt.block_on(async {
        // Structured concurrency: a scope closes to quiescence.
        let cx = Cx::for_request();
        scope!(cx, {
            cx.trace("worker running");
            Outcome::ok(())
        });
    });

    Ok(())
}
```

Notes:
- The `scope!` macro requires the `proc-macros` feature.
- `Cx::for_request()` is convenient for integration testing and request-style entry points.
- Production code should receive `Cx` from runtime-managed tasks when available.
- Use `Cx` and `Scope` for all effects: no ambient authority.
- A region closes to quiescence: all children complete and all finalizers run.
- Cancellation is a protocol (request -> drain -> finalize), not a silent drop.

---

## Effect-Safe Context Wrappers

Framework integrations should wrap `Cx` to provide least-privilege access.

### HTTP (RequestRegion)

```ignore
use asupersync::cx::cap::CapSet;
use asupersync::web::request_region::RequestContext;
use asupersync::web::Response;

type RequestCaps = CapSet<true, true, false, false, false>;

async fn handler(ctx: &RequestContext<'_>) -> Response {
    let cx = ctx.cx_narrow::<RequestCaps>();
    cx.checkpoint()?;
    // spawn/time allowed; IO/remote not exposed
    cx.trace("request handled");
    Response::default()
}
```

For fully read-only handlers, use `ctx.cx_readonly()` to remove all gated APIs.

### gRPC (CallContextWithCx)

```ignore
use asupersync::cx::cap::CapSet;
use asupersync::grpc::{CallContext, CallContextWithCx};

type GrpcCaps = CapSet<true, true, false, false, false>;

fn handle(call: &CallContext, cx: &asupersync::Cx) {
    let ctx = call.with_cx(cx);
    let cx = ctx.cx_narrow::<GrpcCaps>();
    cx.trace("handling request");
}
```

Use `CallContext::with_cx(&cx)` to construct the wrapper.

These wrappers are zero-cost type-level restrictions; they do not alter runtime
behavior, but they remove access to gated APIs at compile time.

---

## Architecture Overview

### Conceptual flow

```
User Future
    -> Scope / Region
        -> Scheduler
            -> Cancellation + Obligations
                -> Trace / Lab Runtime
```

### Core invariants (recap)

- Structured concurrency: every task is owned by exactly one region.
- Region close implies quiescence: no live children, all finalizers done.
- Cancellation is a protocol: request -> drain -> finalize (idempotent).
- Losers are drained after races.
- No obligation leaks: permits/acks/leases must resolve.
- No ambient authority: effects flow through `Cx` and explicit capabilities.

### Obligation leak escalation policy

Obligation leaks are **always** marked as leaked, traced, and counted in metrics.
The escalation policy controls what happens after detection:

- **Lab runtime (default):** `LabConfig::panic_on_leak(true)` maps to
  `ObligationLeakResponse::Panic` — fail fast so tests surface leaks deterministically.
- **Production runtime (default):** `RuntimeConfig.obligation_leak_response = Log` —
  log the leak, emit trace + metrics, and continue (recovery by resolving the leak
  record so regions can quiesce).
- **Recovery-only mode:** `ObligationLeakResponse::Silent` — keep trace + metrics,
  suppress error logs for noisy environments.

Override via `RuntimeBuilder::obligation_leak_response(...)` or
`LabConfig::panic_on_leak(false)` when you need to adjust strictness.

### Module map (Phase 0/1)

- `cx/`: capability context and `Scope` API (entry point for effects)
- `runtime/`: scheduler and runtime state (`RuntimeBuilder`, `Runtime`)
- `cancel/`: cancellation protocol and propagation
- `obligation/`: linear obligations (permits/acks/leases)
- `combinator/`: join/race/timeout combinators
- `lab/`: deterministic runtime, oracles, trace capture
- `trace/` + `record/`: trace events and runtime records
- `types/`: identifiers, outcomes, budgets, policies, time
- `channel/`, `stream/`, `sync/`: cancel-correct primitives
- `transport/`: symbol transport traits and helpers
- `encoding/`, `decoding/`, `raptorq/`: RaptorQ pipelines
- `security/`, `observability/`: auth and structured tracing

### Protocol stack overview

- HTTP/1.1: `src/http/h1/` (codec + client/server helpers)
  - Tests: `tests/http_verification.rs`, fuzz targets `fuzz_http1_request` / `fuzz_http1_response`
- HTTP/2: `src/http/h2/` (frames, HPACK, streams, connection)
  - Tests: `tests/http_verification.rs`, fuzz targets `fuzz_http2_frame` / `fuzz_hpack_decode`
- gRPC: `src/grpc/` (framing, client/server, interceptors)
  - Tests: `tests/grpc_verification.rs`
- WebSocket: `src/net/websocket/` (handshake, frames, client/server)
  - Tests: `tests/e2e_websocket.rs`

### Testing reference

See `TESTING.md` for test categories, logging conventions, conformance suite usage,
and fuzzing instructions.

### wasm32 Guardrails

Browser-targeted compilation is explicitly gated to prevent accidental partial
builds with semantic holes:

- `target_arch = "wasm32"` requires exactly one canonical browser profile:
  - `wasm-browser-minimal`
  - `wasm-browser-dev`
  - `wasm-browser-prod`
  - `wasm-browser-deterministic`
- The following features are compile-time rejected on wasm32:
  - `cli`
  - `io-uring`
  - `tls`
  - `tls-native-roots`
  - `tls-webpki-roots`
  - `sqlite`
  - `postgres`
  - `mysql`
  - `kafka`

Profile composition rules:

- `wasm-browser-minimal` = `wasm-runtime` only (ABI/contract validation lane)
- `wasm-browser-dev` = `wasm-runtime + browser-io`
- `wasm-browser-prod` = `wasm-runtime + browser-io`
- `wasm-browser-deterministic` = `wasm-runtime + deterministic-mode + browser-trace`
- `native-runtime` is forbidden on wasm32 browser builds

Policy and deterministic dependency-audit profiles are documented in
`docs/wasm_dependency_audit_policy.md`.

Optimization-variant policy (`dev`/`canary`/`release`) is defined in
`.github/wasm_optimization_policy.json` and validated by
`scripts/check_wasm_optimization_policy.py`, which emits
`artifacts/wasm_optimization_pipeline_summary.json` for downstream perf/reliability
gates.

### WASM Workspace Slicing Matrix (WASM-02 / `asupersync-umelq.3.4`)

This matrix is the canonical slicing contract for browser compilation closure.
It defines what stays in the wasm browser core path vs what remains optional or
native-only.

| Slice | Browser status | Surface |
|---|---|---|
| Semantic core (required) | always-on in browser profiles | `types`, `record`, `cx`, `cancel`, `obligation`, `combinator`, `runtime` scheduler/cancellation core, `trace` core schema |
| Browser capability/runtime adapters | on for browser profiles that include I/O | `runtime::reactor::browser`, browser-facing I/O/time seams, wasm ABI boundary types |
| Deterministic diagnostics overlay | only in deterministic profile | `browser-trace`, deterministic replay-oriented trace hooks and artifact surfaces |
| Feature-gated optional adapters | off by default in browser profiles | `proc-macros`, `metrics`, `tracing-integration`, `tower`, `trace-compression`, `config-file`, `lock-metrics` |
| Native-only deferred slice | excluded from wasm32 builds | `fs`, `grpc`, `messaging`, `process`, `server`, `signal`, plus `tls`/`database`/`kafka` feature families |

Extraction and optionalization rules:

1. If a module requires native OS primitives (`libc`, `nix`, sockets, process/signal),
   it must stay behind `cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))`.
2. Browser profiles must compile without enabling any deferred native surface.
3. New browser-path code must route effects through explicit capability seams; no
   ambient host access.
4. Changes to this matrix must be reflected in `Cargo.toml` feature closure and
   in `src/lib.rs` compile-time guardrails.

Deterministic validation bundle for this matrix:

```bash
rch exec -- cargo check --target wasm32-unknown-unknown \
  --no-default-features --features wasm-browser-minimal

rch exec -- cargo check --target wasm32-unknown-unknown \
  --no-default-features --features wasm-browser-dev

rch exec -- cargo check --target wasm32-unknown-unknown \
  --no-default-features --features wasm-browser-deterministic
```

Expected outcomes:

- each profile compiles in isolation,
- selecting multiple canonical profiles fails at compile time,
- native-only modules remain excluded from wasm32 closure.

### Browser Edition Documentation IA (WASM-15 / `asupersync-umelq.16.1`)

This section is the canonical information architecture and navigation contract
for Browser Edition docs. Downstream docs beads (`16.2`, `16.3`, `16.4`, `16.5`)
should extend this structure instead of inventing parallel navigation trees.

Primary user journeys:

1. First-use onboarding: install -> run a minimal browser workflow -> verify deterministic behavior.
2. Framework adoption: integrate into React/Next flows without breaking ownership/cancellation semantics.
3. Incident response: capture trace -> replay deterministically -> map findings to mitigation.
4. Security/perf hardening: verify authority boundaries, redaction posture, and budget thresholds.

Navigation top-level (required):

| Lane | Reader intent | Required doc surfaces | Exit criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Concepts` | Understand guarantees and constraints before coding | Browser semantic contract, invariants, capability model, deferred-surface register | Reader can explain what is in-scope vs deferred and why |
| `Quickstart` | Get working minimal app fast | Install/profile selection, minimal code path, deterministic smoke validation | Reader can run one successful browser flow and verify expected output |
| `API + Profiles` | Choose correct runtime/profile/capability envelope | Feature profile matrix, capability wrappers, ABI/ownership boundaries | Reader can select a profile and avoid forbidden surfaces |
| `Framework Guides` | Implement in React/Next/vanilla | Framework-specific bootstrap + lifecycle + cancellation guidance | Reader can integrate without semantic violations |
| `Replay + Diagnostics` | Debug failures with deterministic evidence | Trace schema, replay workflow, artifact commands, failure taxonomy | Reader can reproduce a failure from provided artifacts |
| `Security + Performance` | Validate production-readiness gates | Threat model, policy checks, budgets, CI gates, waiver/escalation rules | Reader can execute gate checks and interpret failures |
| `Troubleshooting` | Recover from known failure patterns | Symptom -> cause -> command -> expected evidence mapping | Reader can resolve common failures without ad-hoc guesswork |

### Browser Runtime Support Boundary (DX Contract)

Browser Edition is **direct-runtime** only where the shipped package guards and
validation evidence explicitly say it is supported. All other environments are
**bridge-only** or out of scope; there is no automatic fallback from an
unsupported runtime into a partially functional direct-execution mode.

Support posture:

- direct runtime today: browser main thread with a real `window` +
  `document` environment and `WebAssembly` support
- bridge-only: Next.js server components, route handlers, edge runtimes, and
  other server-side render environments
- currently unsupported for direct runtime: Node.js-only contexts and browser
  worker/service-worker contexts that do not provide the DOM prerequisites the
  shipped package guards require
- non-goals for browser runtime closure: native-only modules (`fs`, `process`,
  `signal`, `server`), native DB clients, and native transport surfaces

Documentation updates for Browser Edition should keep this boundary explicit and
must not imply automatic fallback from unsupported runtimes into partially
functional direct execution.

### Browser Environment Support Matrix

This matrix is the current shipped support posture for the JS/TS packages, not
an aspirational roadmap.

| Environment | Current posture | Direct runtime allowed | Canonical package surface | Shipped diagnostic contract | Required action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Browser main thread (`window` + `document` + `WebAssembly`) | supported | yes | `@asupersync/browser`, `@asupersync/react`, `@asupersync/next` client target | `reason = "supported"` | create runtime/scope handles here |
| Browser worker / service worker | deferred and currently unsupported | no | none yet | `@asupersync/browser` reports `reason = "missing_browser_dom"` because the current guard requires a DOM window/document | keep direct runtime on the browser main thread; use explicit message/data boundaries until a worker lane is validated and promoted |
| React client-rendered tree in a browser | supported | yes | `@asupersync/react` | `assertReactRuntimeSupport()` returns success only when browser prerequisites are present | import and create runtime from client-rendered components only |
| React SSR / Node render path | bridge-only | no | `@asupersync/react` bridge-only usage only | `REACT_UNSUPPORTED_RUNTIME_CODE` with browser-derived reason/guidance | move runtime creation to the client tree and keep SSR on serialized data/bridge boundaries |
| Next.js client component | supported | yes | `@asupersync/next` with `target = "client"` | `assertNextRuntimeSupport("client")` succeeds only when browser prerequisites are present | import from client components only |
| Next.js server component / route handler | bridge-only | no | `@asupersync/next` bridge-only adapters | `NEXT_UNSUPPORTED_RUNTIME_CODE` with message `Direct Browser Edition runtime execution is unsupported in Next server runtimes.` | move runtime creation into a client component or browser-only module |
| Next.js edge runtime | bridge-only | no | `@asupersync/next` bridge-only adapters | `NEXT_UNSUPPORTED_RUNTIME_CODE` with `target = "edge"` | keep edge code on bridge-only adapters and do not call direct runtime APIs |
| Node.js CLI / tests / serverless code without DOM globals | unsupported for Browser Edition direct runtime | no | use native `asupersync` or explicit bridge code instead | browser/react guards surface `missing_global_this` or `missing_browser_dom` | switch to the native runtime lane or move Browser Edition code behind a browser-only entrypoint |

### Runtime Capability Requirements and Compatibility Guidance

Hard prerequisites enforced today by `detectBrowserRuntimeSupport(...)`:

- browser-like `globalThis`
- `window`
- `document`
- `WebAssembly`

Capability snapshot fields emitted alongside unsupported-runtime diagnostics:

- `hasAbortController`
- `hasDocument`
- `hasFetch`
- `hasWebAssembly`
- `hasWebSocket`
- `hasWindow`

`AbortController`, `fetch`, and `WebSocket` are not currently hard gates for
basic runtime creation, but they are surfaced intentionally so feature-specific
failures can be explained without guesswork.

Shipped unsupported-runtime error contract:

| Package | Error code | Typical unsupported trigger | Correct fallback |
|---|---|---|---|
| `@asupersync/browser` | `ASUPERSYNC_BROWSER_UNSUPPORTED_RUNTIME` | missing `globalThis`, DOM window/document, or `WebAssembly` | load the package from a browser-only entrypoint or use a server/client bridge |
| `@asupersync/react` | `ASUPERSYNC_REACT_UNSUPPORTED_RUNTIME` | SSR or React usage outside a client-rendered browser tree | keep direct runtime creation inside the client tree |
| `@asupersync/next` | `ASUPERSYNC_NEXT_UNSUPPORTED_RUNTIME` | `target = "server"` / `target = "edge"` or missing browser prerequisites in client code | move runtime creation into a client component and keep server/edge code bridge-only |

Package-selection guidance:

- Use `@asupersync/browser` for browser-only modules that directly manage
  runtime, region, task, fetch, or websocket handles.
- Use `@asupersync/react` only inside client-rendered React trees; do not
  initialize Browser Edition during SSR.
- Use `@asupersync/next` only from client components for direct runtime
  behavior; server and edge code should exchange serializable data with a
  browser-owned runtime rather than carrying live handles across the boundary.

Non-goals and fail-closed guardrails:

- no automatic downgrade from unsupported server/edge/node contexts into hidden
  partial direct execution
- no transfer of live browser runtime handles (`BrowserRuntime`, region/task
  handles, cancellation tokens) across client/server boundaries
- no claim that browser-worker direct runtime is currently supported until the
  shipped package guards and validation lanes are updated together
- no support promise for native-only modules or native database/transport
  surfaces in Browser Edition
- no documentation that suggests `@asupersync/next` server or edge code can
  safely call direct Browser Edition runtime constructors

Doc-drift verification hooks (required for Browser Edition doc changes):

1. Link integrity check:
   - ensure every Browser Edition section references at least one concrete artifact/test command.
2. Invariant coverage check:
   - docs must explicitly mention ownership/cancellation/obligation/quiescence impacts where relevant.
3. Profile closure check:
   - docs must not advertise forbidden wasm32 surfaces as supported.
4. Repro command check:
   - each troubleshooting or diagnostics flow must include a deterministic command path.
5. Diagnostic parity check:
   - unsupported-runtime guidance must reference shipped package error codes or support reasons, not invented terminology.

```bash
# Validate rust docs/test snippets and compile surfaces
rch exec -- cargo check --all-targets

# Enforce lint quality on touched code/doc-adjacent surfaces

### Module dependency sketch (high level)

```
Cx/Scope
  -> runtime (scheduler, tasks)
  -> cancel + obligation (protocol + linear tokens)
  -> combinator (join/race/timeout)

lab
  -> runtime
  -> trace

raptorq
  -> encoding/decoding
  -> transport
  -> security
  -> observability
```

### Runtime data flow (high level)

```
Cx::scope or scope! macro
    -> Scope::spawn (wired through runtime state)
        -> Runtime scheduler
            -> Task polls
                -> cx.checkpoint() (cancellation observation)
                -> Effects via capabilities (channels, io, time)
            -> Outcome aggregation
            -> Region close = quiescence
```

### Cancellation state machine

```
Running
  -> CancelRequested
     -> Cancelling (drain)
        -> Finalizing (finalizers)
           -> Completed(Cancelled)
```

### Region lifecycle (conceptual)

```
Open
  -> Closing (cancel requested or scope exit)
     -> Draining (children finish)
        -> Finalizing (finalizers run)
           -> Quiescent
```

### RaptorQ pipeline data flow

```
RaptorQSender / RaptorQReceiver
    -> EncodingPipeline / DecodingPipeline
        -> SecurityContext (sign/verify)
            -> SymbolSink / SymbolStream (transport)
```

### RaptorQ configuration surface

`RaptorQConfig` is the top-level configuration for the RaptorQ pipeline. It
groups all tuning knobs and is validated via `RaptorQConfig::validate()` before
construction.

Key knobs by component:

- `EncodingConfig` (`RaptorQConfig::encoding`)
  - `repair_overhead`: repair factor (e.g., `1.05` = 5% extra symbols)
  - `max_block_size`: max bytes per source block
  - `symbol_size`: symbol size in bytes (typically 64–1024)
  - `encoding_parallelism` / `decoding_parallelism`
- `TransportConfig` (`RaptorQConfig::transport`)
  - `max_paths`, `health_check_interval`, `max_symbols_in_flight`
  - `path_strategy`: `RoundRobin | LatencyWeighted | Adaptive | Random`
- `ResourceConfig` (`RaptorQConfig::resources`)
  - `max_symbol_buffer_memory`, `symbol_pool_size`
  - `max_encoding_ops`, `max_decoding_ops`
- `TimeoutConfig` (`RaptorQConfig::timeouts`)
  - `default_timeout`, `encoding_timeout`, `decoding_timeout`
  - `path_timeout`, `quorum_timeout`
- `SecurityConfig` (`RaptorQConfig::security`)
  - `auth_mode`, `auth_key_seed`, `reject_unauthenticated`

`RuntimeProfile::to_config()` provides baseline presets (`Development`,
`Testing`, `Staging`, `Production`, `HighThroughput`, `LowLatency`).

Note: `RaptorQReceiver` derives a `DecodingConfig` from `RaptorQConfig::encoding`
and uses defaults for the remaining decode knobs (`min_overhead`,
`max_buffered_symbols`, `block_timeout`). For fine-grained decode tuning, use
`DecodingPipeline` directly.

### RaptorQ builder example

```ignore
use asupersync::config::{RaptorQConfig, RuntimeProfile};
use asupersync::raptorq::{RaptorQReceiverBuilder, RaptorQSenderBuilder};

let mut config = RuntimeProfile::Testing.to_config();
config.encoding.symbol_size = 512;
config.encoding.repair_overhead = 1.10;

let sender = RaptorQSenderBuilder::new()
    .config(config.clone())
    .transport(sink)
    .build()?;

let receiver = RaptorQReceiverBuilder::new()
    .config(config)
    .source(stream)
    .build()?;
```

### RaptorQ RFC-6330-grade scope + determinism contract (spec)

This section is the internal spec for the RaptorQ pipeline. It replaces the
current Phase 0 LT/XOR shortcut and defines what "RFC-6330-grade" means for
Asupersync. Implementations should not require constant re-reading of external
standards; where we diverge, we must document it explicitly.

Scope (non-negotiable in full mode):
- Systematic transmission (source symbols first).
- Robust soliton LT layer for repair symbols.
- Deterministic precode (LDPC/HDPC-style constraints or equivalent).
- Deterministic inactivation decoding (peeling + sparse elimination).
- Proof-carrying decode trace artifact (bounded, deterministic).

Divergence ledger (explicit design decisions):
- Determinism is stricter than RFC 6330: all randomness is derived from explicit
  seeds and stable hashing; no ambient RNG or wall-clock.
- Proof artifact emission is required (additional constraint, not in RFC 6330).
- Phase 0 may allow XOR-only test mode, but full mode must use GF(256).

#### Determinism contract

Given:
- input bytes
- `ObjectId`
- `EncodingConfig` / `DecodingConfig`
- explicit seed(s) and policy knobs

Then the following are deterministic and reproducible:
- emitted `SymbolId` and symbol bytes
- degree selection and neighbor sets for repair symbols
- decoding decisions (pivot selection, inactivation set, row-op order)
- proof artifact bytes and final outcome

No ambient randomness and no time-based choices.

#### Seed derivation (canonical)

All pseudo-random decisions are derived from a stable hash of:

```
seed = H(config_hash || object_id || sbn || esi || purpose_tag)
```

Where:
- `config_hash` is a stable hash of the encoding/decoding config
- `object_id`, `sbn`, `esi` are from `SymbolId`
- `purpose_tag` distinguishes degree selection vs neighbor selection vs pivoting

`H` is a fixed, documented hash function; changing it is a protocol-breaking change.

#### Encoder contract (per source block)

1. Segmentation + padding
   - Split bytes into `symbol_size` chunks.
   - Pad deterministically (zero pad + pad length recorded in `ObjectParams`).
   - Partition into source blocks with deterministic `K` per block.

2. Precode / intermediate symbols
   - Map `K` source symbols to `N >= K` intermediate symbols.
   - Precode structure is sparse, stable, and deterministic.
   - Precode parameters are explicit in config and recorded in proof metadata.

3. Systematic emission
   - Emit source symbols first (`ESI < K`), in deterministic order.

4. Repair symbol generation
   - Choose degree `d` via robust soliton distribution (configurable `c`, `delta`).
   - Select `d` neighbors deterministically using the derived seed.
   - Compute repair symbol as a linear combination over GF(256) (full mode).

Neighbor selection and equation construction must be reproducible given
`(object_id, sbn, esi, config_hash, seed)`.

#### Decoder contract (per source block)

1. Ingest
   - Track received symbols and IDs.
   - Reject duplicates deterministically with a precise `RejectReason`.

2. Peeling / belief propagation
   - Repeatedly solve degree-1 equations and substitute into others.
   - Deterministic processing order for the degree-1 queue.

3. Inactivation decoding
   - When peeling stalls, pick an inactivation set deterministically.
   - Perform deterministic elimination (stable row order + stable pivot choice).

4. Completion
   - Recover intermediate symbols, then source symbols.
   - Reassemble bytes and validate padding rule.

#### Proof-carrying decode trace artifact

For each decoded block, emit a compact artifact that allows offline verification:
- config hash + seeds + block sizing metadata
- equation inventory: symbol IDs + neighbor sets used
- elimination trace: pivots, inactivation choices, row ops (bounded)
- final outcome: success or `RejectReason`

The artifact must be:
- deterministic
- bounded in size (explicit caps)
- sufficient to reproduce decoder state transitions and explain failures

#### Proof Artifact Schema + Versioning + Bounds

Schema versioning:
- `PROOF_SCHEMA_VERSION` is a u8 on the artifact. A breaking schema change must bump it.
- Readers version-gate: unknown versions are rejected with a clear error.
- Forward-compat is allowed only for additive fields when the encoding supports it; unknown fields are ignored in that case.

Canonical serialization (for hashing):
- `DecodeProof::content_hash()` must use a deterministic hasher (`util::DetHasher`) and a fixed field order.

#### Proof artifact API surface

- `InactivationDecoder::decode_with_proof(...) -> Result<DecodeResultWithProof, (DecodeError, DecodeProof)>`
  returns a decode result plus a proof artifact (or a failure + proof).
- `DecodeProof::replay_and_verify(symbols)` replays and validates the artifact.
- `DecodeProof::content_hash()` provides a stable fingerprint for deduplication.

Example usage:

```ignore
use asupersync::raptorq::decoder::{InactivationDecoder, ReceivedSymbol};
use asupersync::raptorq::DecodeProof;
use asupersync::types::ObjectId;

let decoder = InactivationDecoder::new(k, symbol_size, seed);
let object_id = ObjectId::new(42);
let sbn = 0u8;

match decoder.decode_with_proof(&symbols, object_id, sbn) {
    Ok(result) => {
        let proof: DecodeProof = result.proof;
        let _fingerprint = proof.content_hash();
        proof.replay_and_verify(&symbols)?;
    }
    Err((_err, proof)) => {
        let _fingerprint = proof.content_hash();
        proof.replay_and_verify(&symbols)?;
    }
}
```
- Integer fields are serialized in little-endian fixed-width form.
- Vectors are serialized in recorded order with a length prefix.

Deterministic ordering requirements:
- `received.esis`, `peeling.solved_indices`, `elimination.inactive_cols`, and `elimination.pivot_events` must be recorded in deterministic order.
- Recommended: sort `esis` by ESI; record peel/inactivation/pivot events in stable row/col order used by the decoder.

Size bounds + truncation:
- `MAX_RECEIVED_SYMBOLS` and `MAX_PIVOT_EVENTS` are hard caps.
- When limits are exceeded, the artifact keeps the first N entries in the deterministic order and sets `truncated = true`.
- Counts (`total`, `solved`, `pivots`, `row_ops`) always reflect the full execution, not just the recorded prefix.

Schema fields (v1):
- `version`: u8 (`PROOF_SCHEMA_VERSION`)
- `config`: { `object_id`, `sbn`, `k`, `s`, `h`, `l`, `symbol_size`, `seed` }
- `received`: { `total`, `source_count`, `repair_count`, `esis[]`, `truncated` }
- `peeling`: { `solved`, `solved_indices[]`, `truncated` }
- `elimination`: { `inactivated`, `inactive_cols[]`, `pivots`, `pivot_events[]`, `row_ops`, `truncated` }
- `outcome`: `Success { symbols_recovered }` | `Failure { reason }`
- `reason`: `InsufficientSymbols { received, required }` | `SingularMatrix { row, attempted_cols[] }` | `SymbolSizeMismatch { expected, actual }`

### Formal Semantics (v4.0.0)

The canonical small-step semantics live in `docs/asupersync_v4_formal_semantics.md`
and are tagged **v4.0.0**. This is the ground-truth model for regions, tasks,
obligations, cancellation, scheduler lanes, and trace equivalence. It is intended
to be mechanically translatable to TLA+/Lean/Coq without a rewrite.

### Proof-Impact Classification and Routing (Track-6 T6.3b)

Use this deterministic classification for runtime-facing changes:

| Class | Deterministic criteria | Required routing |
|------|-------------------------|------------------|
| `none` | Changes only in `docs/**`, `examples/**`, non-conformance test text artifacts, or comments/formatting with no behavior change | 1 maintainer review |
| `local` | Behavioral/code changes confined to one subsystem path (single `src/<subsystem>/**`) and no formal schema/refinement/conformance contract edits | Subsystem owner + 1 reviewer from same domain |
| `cross-cutting` | Any of: touches multiple subsystems, touches `src/cx/**`/`src/runtime/**`/`src/cancel/**`/`src/obligation/**`/`src/lab/**`/`src/trace/**`, touches `formal/lean/**` coverage artifacts, touches conformance/refinement contracts, or changes public API/trace schema | Runtime core owner + formal/refinement owner + conformance owner (all required) |

Module ownership routing map:

| Path prefix | Owner group |
|------------|-------------|
| `src/runtime/**`, `src/cx/**`, `src/cancel/**`, `src/obligation/**` | Runtime Core |
| `src/lab/**`, `src/trace/**`, `formal/lean/**`, `formal/lean/coverage/**` | Formal + Determinism |
| `conformance/**`, `tests/*conformance*`, `tests/*refinement*` | Conformance |
| `src/raptorq/**`, `src/encoding/**`, `src/decoding/**` | RaptorQ |
| `src/security/**`, `src/observability/**` | Security/Observability |

If multiple prefixes match, union all owner groups and treat as `cross-cutting`.

PR/review artifact requirement for critical modules:

```yaml
proof_impact:
  class: none|local|cross-cutting
  touched_paths:
    - <path>
  theorem_touchpoints:
    - <theorem/helper/witness id>
  refinement_mapping_touchpoints:
    - <runtime_state_refinement_map row id or constraint id>
  matched_routing_rules:
    - <rule id or sentence>
  owner_groups_required:
    - <group>
  reviewers_requested:
    - <reviewer/owner>
  conformance_touchpoints:
    - <test or suite name>
  refinement_or_schema_impact: none|yes
  evidence_commands:
    - rch exec -- cargo check --all-targets
    - rch exec -- cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
  review_artifact_location: <PR body section or attached artifact path>
```

Reviewers should reject PRs touching critical modules when this block is missing
or when `class` does not match touched paths.

Additional hard requirements for `local` and `cross-cutting` changes:
1. At least one `theorem_touchpoints` entry.
2. At least one `refinement_mapping_touchpoints` entry.
3. At least one executable entry under `conformance_touchpoints`.
4. `review_artifact_location` must point to where the completed declaration lives.

### Theorem-Assumption Guardrail Checklist (Track-6 T6.2a)

Use this checklist for reliability reviews and incident retrospectives when a
change touches runtime-critical behavior.

Assumption-class mapping:

| Assumption class | Guardrail checks (deterministic) | Primary evidence anchors |
|------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Budget constraints | Deadline/poll/cost bounds remain monotone; no path relaxes child budget beyond parent meet | `Budget` semantics, region/scope budget propagation, timeout tests |
| Cancellation protocol | Request -> drain -> finalize ordering preserved; loser-drain behavior present for race paths; masked sections remain bounded | cancellation state machine, combinator race/join tests, cancel oracles |
| Region lifecycle | Region-close still implies quiescence; no child/task/finalizer leaks at close | region lifecycle invariants, quiescence oracles, close-regression tests |
| Obligation resolution | Every permit/ack/lease path resolves commit/abort; no unresolved obligation exits | obligation leak checks, obligation table metrics, leak/futurelock tests |

Deterministic review checklist (mark each as `pass`/`fail`/`n/a`):

1. `budget_monotonicity`: parent/child budget composition still uses tightening semantics.
2. `cancel_protocol_order`: cancellation order is request -> drain -> finalize in changed paths.
3. `race_loser_drain`: race/hedge paths still cancel and drain losers.
4. `region_quiescence`: changed region lifecycle paths preserve close => quiescence.
5. `obligation_totality`: changed reserve/commit/abort paths remain total (no silent drop).
6. `determinism_surface`: no ambient randomness/time introduced in changed paths.
7. `evidence_commands`: commands and artifacts recorded for reproduction.

Reliability workflow tie-in:

1. During review: attach the checklist in the PR under `proof_guardrails`.
2. During incident triage: map symptom to one assumption class first, then verify corresponding guardrails/evidence.
3. During postmortem: record failed checklist items and link the exact code/test artifacts.

Guardrail-gap escalation rule:
- Any `fail` item without an immediate fix must create a blocker bead (prefix: `[GUARDRAIL-GAP]`) before merge/sign-off.
- Blocker bead must include: impacted assumption class, violated checklist item, reproducible command/artifact, and owner.

Reliability triage classification contract (Track-6 T6):

- Canonical machine-readable source: `formal/lean/coverage/invariant_theorem_test_link_map.json` under `reliability_hardening_contract`.
- Required assumption classes: `budget_constraints`, `cancellation_protocol`, `region_lifecycle`, `obligation_resolution`.
- Each class maps to:
  - linked invariants (`inv.*` IDs),
  - deterministic checklist IDs from this section,
  - conformance artifacts/tests,
  - governance cadence IDs (`weekly`, `phase-exit`),
  - explicit `failure_policy` (`fail-fast` or `fail-safe`) with rationale.

Canonical incident triage flow (must be followed in order):
1. `classify_assumption`: select one assumption class + severity (`sev1|sev2|sev3`).
2. `verify_guardrails`: run class-specific checklist + conformance artifacts.
3. `route_disposition`: apply class policy (`fail-fast` or `fail-safe`) and assign mitigation owner.
4. `governance_escalation`: open/update blocker bead and record governance thread/sign-off status.

Incident forensics playbook (asupersync-umelq.12.5):
- Canonical operator guidance: `docs/replay-debugging.md` ->
  `WASM Incident Forensics Playbook (asupersync-umelq.12.5)`.
- Deterministic drill command:
  `bash ./scripts/run_all_e2e.sh --suite wasm-incident-forensics`
- Contract drift gate:
  `python3 ./scripts/check_incident_forensics_playbook.py`

Governance integration requirement:
- Every unresolved reliability guardrail failure must be reviewed on the same cadence IDs used by the refinement reporting contract in `formal/lean/coverage/runtime_state_refinement_map.json` (`reporting_and_signoff_contract.report_cadence`).

### Proof-Safe Hot-Path Refactor Checklist (Track-6 T6.1b)

Use this checklist for performance-oriented refactors that touch hot paths in:
- `src/runtime/scheduler/**`
- `src/cancel/**`
- `src/obligation/**`
- `src/runtime/task_table.rs` and `src/runtime/sharded_state.rs`

Deterministic checklist (mark each item `pass`/`fail`/`n/a`):

1. `scheduler_lane_contract`: cancel > timed > ready dispatch ordering preserved, including fairness bounds for cancel streaks.
2. `lock_order_contract`: lock acquisition still follows `E(Config) -> D(Instrumentation) -> B(Regions) -> A(Tasks) -> C(Obligations)`.
3. `cancel_protocol_contract`: request -> drain -> finalize ordering remains intact in modified paths.
4. `obligation_contract`: reserve/commit/abort pathways remain total, and no new leak/futurelock surface is introduced.
5. `determinism_contract`: no ambient time/randomness or non-deterministic iteration is introduced on hot paths.
6. `theorem_anchor_contract`: touched behavior is mapped to `formal/lean/coverage/runtime_state_refinement_map.json` and invariant witnesses in `formal/lean/coverage/invariant_theorem_test_link_map.json`.
7. `conformance_contract`: executable checks tied to touched constraints are run and recorded.

Required evidence commands for checklist completion:

```bash
rch exec -- cargo check --all-targets
rch exec -- cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
rch exec -- cargo test --test refinement_conformance -- --nocapture
rch exec -- cargo test --test lean_invariant_theorem_test_link_map -- --nocapture
```

Performance-change review evidence example (bd-2pja4):

```yaml
proof_safe_hot_path_review:
  bead: bd-2pja4
  review_scope:
    - scheduler dispatch fast-path
    - cancellation drain behavior
    - obligation discharge paths
  checklist:
    scheduler_lane_contract: pass
    lock_order_contract: pass
    cancel_protocol_contract: pass
    obligation_contract: pass
    determinism_contract: pass
    theorem_anchor_contract: pass
    conformance_contract: pass
  theorem_artifacts:
    - formal/lean/coverage/runtime_state_refinement_map.json
    - formal/lean/coverage/invariant_theorem_test_link_map.json
  conformance_evidence:
    - tests/refinement_conformance.rs
    - tests/lean_invariant_theorem_test_link_map.rs
```

### Optimization Constraint Sheet (Track-6 T6.1a / bd-3fooi)

Use these constraint IDs in optimization-task design notes and reviews.
Each constraint is proof-linked and has an explicit detection path.

| Constraint ID | Derived from (proof/invariant anchor) | Actionable engineering rule | Detection path |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------|
| `OPT-LOCK-001` | `inv.structured_concurrency.single_owner`, lock-order assumptions in `formal/lean/coverage/runtime_state_refinement_map.json` | Do not introduce new lock acquisition orderings; all multi-lock paths must preserve `E -> D -> B -> A -> C`. | Debug lock-order assertions + scheduler/runtime contention tests |
| `OPT-CANCEL-001` | `inv.cancel.protocol`, cancel-phase witnesses in `src/types/cancel.rs` | Optimizations may not collapse or reorder `request -> drain -> finalize`; cancellation-phase transitions must stay monotone. | `tests/refinement_conformance.rs` cancellation cases |
| `OPT-CANCEL-002` | `inv.race.losers_drained` | Any race/hedge fast path must still cancel and fully drain losers before completion is reported. | race/refinement conformance checks + trace replay assertions |
| `OPT-OBL-001` | `inv.obligation.no_leaks`, obligation theorem map in `formal/lean/coverage/invariant_theorem_test_link_map.json` | Never optimize by bypassing reserve/commit/abort boundaries; obligation resolution must remain total. | obligation leak/futurelock tests + invariant link-map tests |
| `OPT-DET-001` | deterministic replay assumptions in `formal/lean/coverage/runtime_state_refinement_map.json` | No ambient wall-clock or entropy on hot paths; use capability-provided time/randomness only. | replay/refinement tests + deterministic trace fingerprint checks |
| `OPT-HOT-001` | refinement obligations for scheduler/task hot paths | Micro-optimizations (allocation removal, queue reshaping, lock sharding) are allowed only when they preserve all above constraints. | checklist completion + required evidence command bundle |

Constraint usage rule for performance work:

1. Every performance bead touching the listed hot paths must include cited constraint IDs (`OPT-*`) in its notes/review payload.
2. A missing constraint citation is treated as an incomplete proof-impact review.
3. Any violated constraint requires a blocker bead before merge/sign-off.

### Proof-Guided Performance Opportunity Map (Track-6 support / bd-3cp69)

Use this map to choose optimization work that stays inside theorem-backed safety
envelopes.

Prioritization rubric:

| Priority band | Expected impact | Proof coverage confidence | Risk class |
|---------------|-----------------|---------------------------|------------|
| `P0` | High (hot path, multi-workload benefit) | High | Medium |
| `P1` | Medium/high | High or medium | Medium |
| `P2` | Medium | Medium | Medium/high |
| `P3` | Low/uncertain | Low | High |

Opportunity map:

| Opportunity ID | Target surface | Expected impact | Allowed transformations | Prohibited transformations | Required conformance checks | Theorem / invariant anchors | Risk class |
|----------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|
| `PG-OPT-001` | `src/runtime/scheduler/**` dispatch fast path | Lower scheduler overhead and better tail latency under mixed ready/cancel load | queue layout tuning, branch elimination, cache-local metadata packing, lock-contention reduction that preserves lock order | changing cancel > timed > ready lane semantics, reordering multi-lock acquisition (`E -> D -> B -> A -> C`) | `tests/refinement_conformance.rs` scheduler/cancel cases; deterministic replay checks | `OPT-LOCK-001`, `OPT-CANCEL-001`, `OPT-DET-001`; `formal/lean/coverage/runtime_state_refinement_map.json` | Medium |
| `PG-OPT-002` | `src/cancel/**` + race/hedge combinator hot paths | Reduced cancellation-path latency and loser-drain overhead | reduce allocations on cancel/drain path, streamline witness construction, deduplicate wake/drain bookkeeping | collapsing request -> drain -> finalize phases, reporting completion before loser drain | race/hedge conformance cases; cancel protocol assertions in refinement suite | `OPT-CANCEL-001`, `OPT-CANCEL-002`; `formal/lean/coverage/invariant_theorem_test_link_map.json` | Medium |
| `PG-OPT-003` | `src/obligation/**`, `src/runtime/obligation_table.rs` | Lower obligation bookkeeping overhead in high-concurrency workflows | data-structure reshaping, indexed lookup improvements, lock-scoping reductions that preserve lifecycle semantics | bypassing reserve/commit/abort boundaries, deferred or best-effort obligation resolution | obligation leak/futurelock tests; invariant link-map checks | `OPT-OBL-001`, `OPT-DET-001`; `formal/lean/coverage/invariant_theorem_test_link_map.json` | Medium/high |
| `PG-OPT-004` | `src/runtime/task_table.rs`, `src/runtime/sharded_state.rs` | Better throughput via cache-local table operations and reduced contention | table compaction/locality improvements, sharding refinements with unchanged ownership semantics | introducing cross-shard ownership ambiguity, non-deterministic iteration order in state transitions | task/region lifecycle conformance checks; deterministic trace fingerprint checks | `OPT-HOT-001`, `OPT-LOCK-001`, `OPT-DET-001`; `formal/lean/coverage/runtime_state_refinement_map.json` | Medium |

Optimization-envelope template (required in performance beads):

```yaml
proof_guided_optimization:
  opportunity_id: PG-OPT-###
  expected_impact: high|medium|low
  risk_class: low|medium|high
  allowed_transformations:
    - <change type>
  prohibited_transformations:
    - <must not change>
  theorem_links:
    - <OPT-* constraint id>
    - <coverage artifact path>
  required_checks:
    - rch exec -- cargo check --all-targets
    - rch exec -- cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
    - rch exec -- cargo test --test refinement_conformance -- --nocapture
  evidence:
    metrics_before: <artifact/link>
    metrics_after: <artifact/link>
    determinism_proof: <artifact/link>
```

Use this map as the default intake filter for Track-6 performance candidates:
- If a candidate cannot be mapped to one `PG-OPT-*` envelope with explicit
  theorem linkage, do not start implementation.
- If a candidate violates any prohibited transformation, create a blocker bead
  first and route through proof-impact review.

## API Reference Orientation

Asupersync exposes a small, capability-focused public API. The canonical list of
public items lives in `src/lib.rs` re-exports. Use `cargo doc --no-deps` for full
rustdoc output.

### Core types

- `Cx`, `Scope`: capability context and region-scoped API
- `Outcome`, `OutcomeError`, `CancelKind`, `CancelReason`, `Severity`
- `Budget`, `Time`, `Policy`
- `RegionId`, `TaskId`, `ObligationId`

### Runtime

- `runtime::RuntimeBuilder`: build and configure runtimes
- `runtime::Runtime`: runtime handle (`block_on`)

### Cancellation + obligations

- `cancel/`: cancellation protocol and propagation
- `obligation/`: linear obligations (permits/acks/leases)

### Combinators

- `combinator/`: join, race, timeout, hedge, quorum, pipeline patterns

### Lab runtime + oracles

- `LabRuntime`, `LabConfig`: deterministic testing
- `lab` oracles: quiescence, obligation leak, trace checks

### RaptorQ integration

- `RaptorQConfig` + `EncodingConfig` + `DecodingConfig`
- `RaptorQSenderBuilder`, `RaptorQReceiverBuilder`
- `RaptorQSender`, `RaptorQReceiver`, `SendOutcome`, `ReceiveOutcome`

### Transport + security + observability

- `transport::SymbolSink` / `transport::SymbolStream`
- `security::SecurityContext` for signing/verifying symbols
- `Cx::trace` + `observability::Metrics` for structured telemetry

### Spork (OTP Mental Model on Asupersync)

Spork is the OTP-grade library layer being built on top of Asupersync's core
invariants: structured concurrency, explicit cancellation, obligation linearity,
and deterministic lab execution.

Think of Spork as:
- OTP ergonomics (supervision, naming, call/cast, link/monitor)
- mapped onto region ownership and outcome semantics
- with deterministic replay/debugging as a first-class feature

#### OTP -> Asupersync Mapping

| OTP concept | Spork / Asupersync mapping |
|------------|-----------------------------|
| Process | Region-owned task/actor (never detached) |
| Supervisor | Compiled restart topology over regions |
| Link | Failure coupling via supervision/escalation rules |
| Monitor + DOWN | Observation channel with deterministic ordering |
| Registry | Name leases as obligations (commit/abort, no stale ownership) |
| call/cast | Request-response vs fire-and-forget mailbox flows |

#### Capability Wiring Patterns (No Globals)

Spork is capability-driven: if you cannot reach it from `Cx` (or a handle derived
from `Cx`), you do not have authority to use it. This keeps the runtime free of
ambient singletons and makes lab execution deterministic and replayable.

Patterns:

- **Registry injection (capability-scoped naming)**:
  - Construct a registry capability and pass it into your app spec.
  - All child contexts spawned by the app inherit the same registry handle.

  ```ignore
  use asupersync::spork::prelude::*;
  use std::sync::Arc;

  let registry = NameRegistry::new();
  let registry = RegistryHandle::new(Arc::new(registry));

  let app = AppSpec::new("my_app")
      .with_registry(registry)
      .child(/* ... */);
  ```

- **Remote spawning (explicit distributed authority)**:
  - Attach a `RemoteCap` to the root `Cx` (tests) or configure it via your runtime
    boundary.
  - Child scopes inherit the capability, so code does not reach for globals.

  ```ignore
  use asupersync::{Cx, remote::{RemoteCap, NodeId}};

  let cx = Cx::for_testing()
      .with_remote_cap(RemoteCap::new().with_local_node(NodeId::new("origin-a")));
  ```

- **Trace / evidence plumbing (observability as a capability)**:
  - Use `Cx::trace` (structured) rather than stdout/stderr.
  - In the lab runtime, traces are collected into replayable buffers and child
    tasks inherit the trace context automatically.

- **Lab vs prod driver selection (determinism boundary)**:
  - Use `lab::LabRuntime` for deterministic schedule exploration and oracle checks.
  - Use `runtime::RuntimeBuilder` for production configuration (drivers, pools,
    observability exporters).

#### Failure and Outcome Semantics

Spork uses Asupersync's four-valued outcome lattice:

```text
Ok < Err < Cancelled < Panicked
```

Key rule: failed executions are immutable facts in traces. Recovery is modeled
by starting new executions, not rewriting old outcomes.

Practical implications:
- `Err` may restart (policy + budget dependent)
- `Cancelled` typically maps to stop (external directive)
- `Panicked` maps to stop/escalate (never "healed" in place)

See:
- `docs/spork_glossary_invariants.md` (INV-6, INV-6A)
- `src/supervision.rs` (`Supervisor::on_failure`)

#### Deterministic Incident Workflow (Spork-oriented)

1. Reproduce with lab runtime using fixed seed/config.
2. Capture trace/crash artifacts (canonical fingerprints + replay inputs).
3. Inspect supervision decisions and ordering-sensitive events.
4. Replay the same seed and verify identical decisions.
5. Adjust policy/budget/topology and re-run until invariant holds.

This turns "flaky OTP behavior" into deterministic, auditable steps.

See:
- `docs/spork_deterministic_ordering.md`
- `docs/spork_glossary_invariants.md`
- `src/trace/crashpack.rs`
- `src/lab/runtime.rs`

#### Current Surface Status

The Spork layer is actively being built. For concrete API shape and module map:
- `docs/spork_glossary_invariants.md` (Section 1 glossary, Section 6 API map)
- `docs/spork_deterministic_ordering.md` (mailbox/down/registry ordering contracts)

## Tutorials

### 1) Getting Started: Structured Concurrency

```ignore
use asupersync::{Cx, Outcome};
use asupersync::proc_macros::scope;

async fn worker(cx: &Cx) -> Outcome<(), asupersync::Error> {
    cx.trace("worker start");
    cx.checkpoint()?;
    // ... do work ...
    Outcome::ok(())
}

async fn root(cx: Cx) -> Outcome<(), asupersync::Error> {
    scope!(cx, {
        let _ = worker(&cx).await;
        Outcome::ok(())
    });

    Outcome::ok(())
}
```

Key points:
- Always observe cancellation via `cx.checkpoint()` in loops.
- Leaving a region means all children are complete and drained.

### 2) Reliable Transfer: RaptorQ Sender/Receiver

```ignore
use asupersync::config::RaptorQConfig;
use asupersync::raptorq::{RaptorQReceiverBuilder, RaptorQSenderBuilder};
use asupersync::transport::mock::{sim_channel, SimTransportConfig};
use asupersync::types::symbol::{ObjectId, ObjectParams};
use asupersync::Cx;

let cx = Cx::for_request();
let config = RaptorQConfig::default();
let (mut sink, mut stream) = sim_channel(SimTransportConfig::reliable());

let mut sender = RaptorQSenderBuilder::new()
    .config(config.clone())
    .transport(sink)
    .build()?;
let mut receiver = RaptorQReceiverBuilder::new()
    .config(config)
    .source(stream)
    .build()?;

let object_id = ObjectId::new_random();
let data = b"hello raptorq";
let _outcome = sender.send_object(&cx, object_id, data)?;

// In real systems, transmit ObjectParams alongside the payload metadata.
let params = /* ObjectParams derived from sender metadata */;
let decoded = receiver.receive_object(&cx, &params)?;
assert_eq!(decoded.data, data);
```

Notes:
- `send_object` and `receive_object` use `Cx` for cancellation.
- For production, replace `sim_channel` with a real `SymbolSink`/`SymbolStream`.

### 3) Custom Transport: Implement SymbolSink / SymbolStream

Implement the transport traits to plug in a custom network backend.

```rust
use asupersync::transport::{SymbolSink, SymbolStream};

struct MySink { /* ... */ }
struct MyStream { /* ... */ }

impl SymbolSink for MySink {
    // implement poll_send, poll_flush, poll_close
}

impl SymbolStream for MyStream {
    // implement poll_next
}
```

Guidelines:
- Make cancellation checks explicit via `Cx` at symbol boundaries.
- Ensure `poll_close` drains buffers and releases resources.

### 4) Observability: Structured Tracing

```rust
cx.trace("request_start");
// ... work ...
cx.trace("request_done");
```

Use `Cx::trace` for deterministic lab traces and runtime logs. Avoid direct
stdout/stderr printing in core logic.

### Tutorial: Build a Supervised Named Service (Spork, planned surface)

This walkthrough shows the intended flow for a small OTP-style service:

1. define a GenServer-like process for stateful request handling
2. register a stable name via registry lease semantics
3. run under supervisor policy with restart budget
4. use monitor/link-style failure observation/propagation
5. validate behavior in lab runtime with deterministic replay

Status note:
- End-to-end Spork app wiring is still being finalized, but the core pieces
  below are real APIs you can use today.

Compile a deterministic supervisor topology:

```no_run
use asupersync::{Budget, TaskId};
use asupersync::supervision::{
    ChildSpec, RestartConfig, SupervisionStrategy, SupervisorBuilder,
};

let compiled = SupervisorBuilder::new("counter_root")
    .child(
        ChildSpec::new("counter_service", |_scope, _state, _cx| {
            Ok(TaskId::new_ephemeral())
        })
        .with_restart(SupervisionStrategy::Restart(RestartConfig::default()))
        .with_shutdown_budget(Budget::INFINITE.with_poll_quota(1_000)),
    )
    .compile()?;

assert_eq!(compiled.start_order.len(), 1);
# Ok::<(), asupersync::supervision::SupervisorCompileError>(())
```

Use lease-backed registry naming (no ambient globals, no stale-name ambiguity):

```no_run
use asupersync::cx::NameRegistry;
use asupersync::{RegionId, TaskId, Time};

let mut registry = NameRegistry::new();
let mut lease = registry.register(
    "counter",
    TaskId::new_ephemeral(),
    RegionId::new_ephemeral(),
    Time::ZERO,
)?;
assert!(registry.whereis("counter").is_some());

// On graceful stop: resolve the obligation and remove discoverability.
lease.release()?;
registry.unregister("counter")?;
# Ok::<(), asupersync::cx::NameLeaseError>(())
```

Runnable minimal end-to-end example:

```bash
cargo run --example spork_minimal_supervised_app
```

This example lives at `examples/spork_minimal_supervised_app.rs` and demonstrates:
- app start under a supervisor-owned region
- supervised named GenServer start
- client `cast` + `call`
- cancel-correct shutdown (`request -> drain -> finalize`)
- deterministic lease/name cleanup (`whereis("counter") == None` after stop)

What to verify in lab tests:
- region close implies quiescence (no live descendants)
- no obligation leaks (reply/name leases resolve)
- restart policy behavior is deterministic for same seed
- monitor/down ordering is replay-stable

### Session-Typed Obligations

The opt-in session-typed obligation surface lives in
`src/obligation/session_types.rs`. The code now publishes a rollout contract via
`session_protocol_adoption_specs()` so the typed API and the legacy
runtime-checked API stay unambiguous during adoption.

First-wave protocol families:

- `send_permit`: adopt first on explicit reserve/send-or-abort paths that
  already resolve a `SendPermit` through the obligation ledger.
- `lease`: adopt first on lease-backed naming/resource lifecycles with a single
  obvious holder and an explicit release path.
- `two_phase`: adopt first on reserve/commit-or-abort effect APIs where the
  fallback remains `ObligationLedger::{commit, abort}`.

Each adoption spec documents:

1. Canonical states and transitions for migration review.
2. Compile-time guarantees from typestate linearity.
3. Runtime oracle complements that remain authoritative during rollout.
4. Existing migration/compile-fail validation surfaces.
5. Stable diagnostics fields required to debug typed-protocol adoption.

Current AA-05.3 validation surfaces:

- compile-fail doctests in `src/obligation/session_types.rs`
- typed/dynamic migration parity in `tests/session_type_obligations.rs`
- rollout contract/unit invariants in `src/obligation/session_types.rs`

Direct `rch` rerun commands:

- `rch exec -- cargo test --doc -- --nocapture`
- `rch exec -- cargo test --test session_type_obligations -- --nocapture`

Troubleshooting rules:

- If a compile-fail example starts compiling, treat it as a typestate regression and keep the typed surface experimental.
- If typed and dynamic paths disagree on the valid resolution shape, treat `src/obligation/ledger.rs` as authoritative and debug the typed wrapper before expanding rollout scope.
- When diagnosing rollout issues, log and inspect the stable fields `channel_id`, `from_state`, `to_state`, `trace_id`, `obligation_kind`, `protocol`, and `transition`.

Current runtime-oracle complements:

- `src/obligation/ledger.rs`
- `src/obligation/marking.rs`
- `src/obligation/no_leak_proof.rs`
- `src/obligation/no_aliasing_proof.rs`
- `src/obligation/dialectica.rs`
- `src/obligation/separation_logic.rs`
- `src/cx/registry.rs`

Adoption rule:

- Use the typed surface where the protocol boundary is already explicit.
- Keep the legacy dynamic surface as the fallback and audit/reference oracle.
- Do not start with open-ended adapter layers or flows that rely on implicit
  cleanup by `Drop`.

### Restricted Static Leak Checker Pilot

The restricted AA-05.2 static-analysis pilot lives in
`src/obligation/leak_check.rs`. It does not attempt whole-Rust analysis.
Instead, it makes the structured-IR boundary explicit with
`static_leak_check_contract()` and returns a conservative graded-budget summary
through `CheckResult::graded_budget`.

What the pilot now guarantees on its covered surface:

- deterministic machine-readable diagnostic codes for CI/logging
- stable structured-IR locations for instruction and scope-exit findings
- remediation hints paired with each diagnostic class
- conservative peak outstanding-obligation counts on the same `Body` IR

What remains intentionally out of scope:

- loops/recursion without explicit IR unrolling
- interprocedural aliasing or ownership transfer not represented in `Body`
- ambient `Drop` cleanup or runtime side effects outside the IR
- Rust-source parsing, macro expansion, and dynamic dispatch analysis

Interpretation rule:

- A clean result means the supplied structured IR is balanced.
- It does not replace runtime enforcement for uncovered patterns.
- `src/obligation/ledger.rs`, `src/obligation/marking.rs`,
  `src/obligation/no_leak_proof.rs`, and `src/obligation/graded.rs`
  remain the authoritative runtime/oracle surfaces.

### Evidence Ledger (Galaxy-Brain Mode)

For explainability, the runtime can emit an **evidence ledger**: a compact,
deterministic record of *why* a cancellation/race/scheduler decision occurred.
This is trace-backed and safe for audit/debugging.

Conceptual schema (stable, deterministic):

```
EvidenceEntry = {
  decision_id: u64,
  kind: "cancel" | "race" | "scheduler",
  context: {
    task_id: TaskId,
    region_id: RegionId,
    lane: DispatchLane
  },
  candidates: [Candidate],
  constraints: [Constraint],
  chosen: CandidateId,
  rationale: [Reason],
  witnesses: [TraceEventId]
}

Candidate = {
  id: CandidateId,
  score: i64,
  delta_v: i64,
  invariants: [InvariantCheck]
}
```

Renderer guidelines:
- One-line summary (decision + top reason).
- Optional expanded view: candidate table + constraint violations.
- Deterministic ordering of fields and candidates.

Runtime hooks (non-exhaustive):
- Cancellation: record why a task was cancelled vs drained.
- Race: record winner selection and loser-drain reasoning.
- Scheduler: record why task X was chosen over task Y (lane + score).

This ledger should be bounded in size and emitted via tracing/trace events,
never stdout/stderr.

### 5) Distributed Regions (conceptual)

The distributed API is in-progress. The intent is to provide region-scoped
fault tolerance with explicit leases and idempotency. Today there are two
entrypoints: `distributed` for region snapshot/replication/recovery, and
`remote` for named computations with leases and idempotency. The `remote`
surface is Phase 0 (handle-only; no network transport yet), and all remote
operations require `RemoteCap` from `Cx` (no closure shipping).

---

### 6) Remote Protocol Spec (Named Computations)

This section defines the Phase 1+ **remote structured concurrency protocol**.
It is transport-agnostic and uses the message types defined in `src/remote.rs`
(`RemoteMessage`, `SpawnRequest`, `SpawnAck`, `CancelRequest`, `ResultDelivery`,
`LeaseRenewal`).

**Goals**
- Deterministic, replayable message encoding.
- No closure shipping: only named computations.
- Explicit capability checks and computation registry validation.
- Idempotent spawns with exactly-once semantics (from the originator's view).
- Lease-based liveness with explicit expiry behavior.

#### 6.1 Handshake (transport-level)

Before exchanging `RemoteMessage` envelopes, peers perform a transport-level
handshake:

```
Hello = {
  protocol_version: "1.0",
  node_id: "node-a",
  clock_kind: "lamport" | "vector" | "hybrid",
  registry_hash: "hex_sha256",
  capabilities: ["remote_spawn", "lease_renewal", "cancel", "result_delivery"]
}
```

Rules:
- **Major version mismatch** -> connection rejected.
- **Minor version mismatch** -> allowed if receiver supports the sender's minor.
- `registry_hash` is the hash of the *named computation registry*; mismatch
  is allowed but MUST be logged and MAY trigger `UnknownComputation` rejections.
- Capability negotiation is **deny by default**: if the receiver does not list
  a capability, the sender MUST NOT depend on it.

`RemoteTransport::send()` implementations are responsible for enforcing
handshake completion and version checks.

#### 6.2 Serialization Format (deterministic)

All protocol frames use **canonical CBOR (RFC 8949)** with deterministic
map key ordering. Implementations MAY additionally expose JSON debug encoding
for test vectors, but canonical CBOR is the wire format.

Canonical type mappings:
- `NodeId` -> UTF-8 string
- `RemoteTaskId` -> u64
- `IdempotencyKey` -> hex string `"IK-<32 hex>"` (lowercase)
- `Time` / `Duration` -> u64 nanoseconds
- `RegionId`, `TaskId` -> `{ "index": u32, "generation": u32 }`
- `RemoteInput` / `RemoteOutcome::Success` payload -> byte string (CBOR bytes)

#### 6.3 Envelope Schema

```
RemoteEnvelope = {
  version: "1.0",
  sender: NodeId,
  sender_time: LogicalTime,
  payload: RemoteMessage
}

LogicalTime =
  | { kind: "lamport", value: u64 }
  | { kind: "vector", entries: [{ node: NodeId, counter: u64 }, ...] }
  | { kind: "hybrid", physical_ns: u64, logical: u64 }
```

`vector` entries MUST be sorted by `node` for determinism.

#### 6.4 Message Schemas

**SpawnRequest**
```
{
  type: "SpawnRequest",
  remote_task_id: u64,
  computation: "encode_block",
  input: <bytes>,
  lease_ns: u64,
  idempotency_key: "IK-...",
  budget: { deadline_ns?: u64, poll_quota: u32, cost_quota?: u64, priority: u8 } | null,
  origin_node: NodeId,
  origin_region: { index: u32, generation: u32 },
  origin_task: { index: u32, generation: u32 }
}
```

**SpawnAck**
```
{
  type: "SpawnAck",
  remote_task_id: u64,
  status: { kind: "accepted" } |
          { kind: "rejected", reason: "UnknownComputation" | "CapacityExceeded" |
                               "NodeShuttingDown" | "InvalidInput" | "IdempotencyConflict",
            detail?: "string" },
  assigned_node: NodeId
}
```

**CancelRequest**
```
{
  type: "CancelRequest",
  remote_task_id: u64,
  reason: CancelReason,
  origin_node: NodeId
}
```

**ResultDelivery**
```
{
  type: "ResultDelivery",
  remote_task_id: u64,
  outcome: RemoteOutcome,
  execution_time_ns: u64
}
```

**LeaseRenewal**
```
{
  type: "LeaseRenewal",
  remote_task_id: u64,
  new_lease_ns: u64,
  current_state: "Pending" | "Running" | "Completed" | "Failed" | "Cancelled" | "LeaseExpired",
  node: NodeId
}
```

**CancelReason** (minimal, deterministic encoding)
```
{
  kind: "User" | "Timeout" | "Deadline" | "PollQuota" | "CostBudget" |
        "FailFast" | "RaceLost" | "ParentCancelled" | "ResourceUnavailable" | "Shutdown",
  origin_region: { index: u32, generation: u32 },
  origin_task: { index: u32, generation: u32 } | null,
  timestamp_ns: u64,
  message: "static_string" | null,
  cause: CancelReason | null,
  truncated: bool,
  truncated_at_depth: u32 | null
}
```

**RemoteOutcome**
```
{ kind: "Success", output: <bytes> } |
{ kind: "Failed", message: "string" } |
{ kind: "Cancelled", reason: CancelReason } |
{ kind: "Panicked", message: "string" }
```

Capability checks:
- Originator MUST hold `RemoteCap` in `Cx` to issue a `SpawnRequest`.
- Remote node MUST validate computation name against its registry and
  MUST reject unauthorized computations (`UnknownComputation` or
  `InvalidInput`).

#### 6.5 Idempotency Rules

- Each `SpawnRequest` MUST include an `IdempotencyKey`.
- On duplicate request with same key:
  - If computation + input match: return the original `SpawnAck` without re-executing.
  - If computation + input differ: respond with `SpawnAck` rejected
    `IdempotencyConflict`.
- Idempotency records expire per `IdempotencyStore` TTL; expired keys are treated
  as new requests.

#### 6.6 Lease Rules

- The originator sets `lease_ns` (default from `RemoteCap`).
- The remote node MUST send `LeaseRenewal` within the lease window while running.
- If the originator misses renewals and the lease expires, it transitions the
  handle to `RemoteTaskState::LeaseExpired`. Implementations MAY send a
  `CancelRequest` to request cleanup, but should not assume delivery.

#### 6.7 Compatibility & Versioning

- Unknown fields MUST be ignored (forward compatibility).
- Missing required fields MUST reject the message.
- Major version mismatch => disconnect; minor mismatch => accept if supported.
- `sender_time` kinds may differ; if incompatible, receivers treat causal order
  as `Concurrent` and proceed without ordering assumptions.

#### 6.8 Test Vectors (JSON, debug-only)

For JSON debug vectors, `input` / `output` byte fields are base64 strings.

**SpawnRequest**
```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "sender": "node-a",
  "sender_time": { "kind": "lamport", "value": 7 },
  "payload": {
    "type": "SpawnRequest",
    "remote_task_id": 42,
    "computation": "encode_block",
    "input": "AQID",
    "lease_ns": 30000000000,
    "idempotency_key": "IK-0000000000000000000000000000002a",
    "budget": { "deadline_ns": 60000000000, "poll_quota": 10000, "cost_quota": null, "priority": 128 },
    "origin_node": "node-a",
    "origin_region": { "index": 12, "generation": 1 },
    "origin_task": { "index": 98, "generation": 3 }
  }
}
```

**SpawnAck (accepted)**
```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "sender": "node-b",
  "sender_time": { "kind": "lamport", "value": 9 },
  "payload": {
    "type": "SpawnAck",
    "remote_task_id": 42,
    "status": { "kind": "accepted" },
    "assigned_node": "node-b"
  }
}
```

**ResultDelivery (success)**
```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "sender": "node-b",
  "sender_time": { "kind": "lamport", "value": 14 },
  "payload": {
    "type": "ResultDelivery",
    "remote_task_id": 42,
    "outcome": { "kind": "Success", "output": "BAUG" },
    "execution_time_ns": 1200000000
  }
}
```

#### 6.9 Stub Implementation Hooks

The Phase 0 harness and runtime already include hook points for integrating
the protocol:

- `src/remote.rs`: `RemoteTransport` trait (`send`, `try_recv`)
- `src/remote.rs`: `MessageEnvelope` + `RemoteMessage` types
- `src/remote.rs`: `trace_events::*` constants for structured tracing
- `src/lab/network/harness.rs`: `encode_message` / `decode_message` placeholder codec

These locations are the intended integration points for the real transport
and wire codec.

---

## Configuration Reference (high level)

Asupersync centralizes configuration in `RaptorQConfig` and related structs.

- `RaptorQConfig`: primary configuration facade
- `EncodingConfig`: symbol size, block size, repair overhead
- `DecodingConfig`: buffer caps, timeouts, verification flags
- `TransportConfig`: buffer sizes, multipath policy, routing
- `SecurityConfig`: authentication mode and keying
- `TimeoutConfig`: deadlines and time budgets
- `ResourceConfig`: pool sizes and backpressure limits

Use `ConfigLoader` for file/env based loading. Validate configs before use.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Obligation leak
A task completed while holding a permit/ack/lease.

- Ensure permits are always committed or aborted.
- Use lab runtime oracles to detect leaks deterministically.

### Region close timeout
A region is waiting on children that never reach a checkpoint.

- Add `cx.checkpoint()` in loops.
- Avoid holding obligations across blocking waits.

### Non-deterministic failures
Intermittent failures usually indicate schedule sensitivity.

- Prefer `LabRuntime` with a fixed seed for reproducibility.
- Capture traces and replay to isolate schedule-dependent bugs.
- Use `lab::assert_deterministic` to validate stable outcomes.

### Slow shutdown or hanging tests
If shutdown never completes or tests hang:

- Ensure request/connection loops call `cx.checkpoint()`.
- Propagate budgets to child regions and timeouts to I/O.
- Confirm finalizers release obligations and permits.
