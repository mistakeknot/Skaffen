# Security Review and Threat Model

Status: draft
Last updated: 2026-02-28
Owner: asupersync-umelq.14.2

## Scope

This document covers security risks and mitigations for the Asupersync runtime and
its protocol stack, with focus on:

- Runtime core (scheduler, cancellation, obligations, trace)
- TLS integration and crypto hygiene
- HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, gRPC, WebSocket protocol handling
- Messaging clients (Redis, NATS, Kafka)
- Deterministic lab runtime and replay tooling

## Non-goals

- OS kernel security, CPU micro-architecture attacks
- Supply-chain policy beyond basic dependency hygiene
- Full formal verification (tracked separately)

## Assets and Security Goals

Primary assets and goals:

- Correctness invariants: structured concurrency, no orphan tasks, no obligation leaks
- Cancellation correctness: request -> drain -> finalize, bounded cleanup
- Protocol safety: no uncontrolled memory/CPU growth, fail-safe parsing
- Integrity of traces and diagnostics (no corrupted replay data)
- Confidentiality of TLS sessions and protected data in transit
- Deterministic testing: reproducible traces, no ambient randomness

## Trust Boundaries

- Untrusted network input: all protocol decoders, stream parsers, and framing
- Runtime boundary: user code is untrusted and may misbehave
- Cancellation boundary: drop-based cancellation is not trusted to be safe
- External dependencies: crates with unsafe internals may contain vulnerabilities

## Attacker Models

- Remote unauthenticated attacker: malformed protocol inputs, DoS via resource exhaustion
- Remote authenticated attacker: protocol misuse, request smuggling, stream abuse
- Local attacker (same host): abuse of file paths, permissions, or local sockets
- Malicious library user: misuse of APIs, intentional invariant violations

## Browser/WASM Threat Addendum (asupersync-umelq.14.1)

This addendum defines browser-specific security assumptions and controls for the
`wasm-browser-preview` surface.

### Threat Assumptions

- Browser host and JavaScript environment are untrusted from the runtime point of view.
- Network authority must be explicit (`Cx` + `IoCap`) and never ambient.
- Fetch capability authority is default-deny; every origin/method/credential grant is explicit.
- Replay artifacts are potentially exfiltratable unless treated as sensitive outputs.
- Dependency compromise remains possible; policy gates must prevent forbidden runtime surfaces.

### STRIDE-style Threat Matrix (Browser Scope)

| Category | Browser Abuse Case | Required Control |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Spoofing | Untrusted origin impersonates approved backend | Default-deny origin policy + explicit origin allowlist in `FetchAuthority` |
| Tampering | Script mutates request shape to bypass policy | Method allowlist + header-count cap + invalid URL rejection |
| Repudiation | Missing provenance for security decisions | Structured security diagnostics + deterministic test replay commands |
| Information Disclosure | Replay/log artifacts expose secrets/tokens | Redaction requirements + no secret-bearing stdout/stderr |
| Denial of Service | Oversized headers/bodies or hostile request patterns | Hard policy bounds (`max_header_count`, protocol size limits) |
| Elevation of Privilege | Ambient fetch/credentials escalation without capability | Capability-gated `IoCap::fetch_cap()` + default-deny grants (origin/method/credentials) |

### Explicit Policy Checks and Adversarial Tests

- `tests/security_invariants.rs` (`browser_fetch_security` module) enforces:
  - default authority deny-all behavior,
  - untrusted origin denial,
  - method escalation denial,
  - credential-default-deny behavior,
  - header-count bound enforcement,
  - malformed URL rejection.
- `src/io/cap.rs` unit tests enforce authority and policy wiring through `BrowserFetchIoCap`.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs full test gates; failures include deterministic
  test names and replayable commands.

### Deterministic Repro Commands

For local reproduction with remote offload:

```bash
rch exec -- cargo test --test security_invariants browser_fetch_security -- --nocapture
rch exec -- cargo test --lib io::cap -- --nocapture
rch exec -- cargo test --test security -- --nocapture
```

For CI parity checks:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_wasm_dependency_policy.py --policy .github/wasm_dependency_policy.json
cargo test --test security_invariants browser_fetch_security -- --nocapture
```

### Residual Risk Register (Browser Scope)

| Risk | Why Residual | Current Mitigation | Closure Trigger |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Third-party package compromise in JS toolchains | Rust-level controls cannot fully govern npm/bundler supply chain | Dependency policy gate + lockfile review + reproducible CI artifacts | Signed provenance + policy-enforced package allowlist for browser SDK distribution |
| Replay artifact over-collection | Traces can capture sensitive operational context if emitted too broadly | Redaction guidance + scoped diagnostics + no secret stdout/stderr | Automated artifact redaction validation gate in CI |
| Host bridge misuse by integrators | Browser embedding layer can accidentally widen authority in app code | Explicit `FetchAuthority` contract with default-deny grants (origin/method/credentials) | Contract tests for all host adapters plus policy check in release gate |

## Trace/Telemetry Privacy Model (`asupersync-umelq.14.4`)

Normative policy source: `.github/security_release_policy.json` section
`trace_telemetry_privacy` (`trace-telemetry-privacy-v1`).

Data minimization classes:
- `secret`: credentials/tokens/password-like material; never persisted in replay/telemetry artifacts.
- `sensitive`: potentially identifying payload/log details; allowed only in redacted form.
- `metadata`: routing + reproducibility metadata (`suite`, `scenario_id`, `seed`, replay command) retained for forensics.

Redaction modes and opt-in levels:
- `metadata_only` (default): keeps deterministic reproduction metadata, strips sensitive payload fields.
- `strict`: stronger minimization with the same replay contract guarantees.
- `none`: local-only opt-in for debugging; forbidden in CI.

Retention and storage scope:
- Local default/max: 14 days.
- CI default/max: 30 days.
- Approved artifact path fragments:
  - `/target/e2e-results/`
  - `/target/phase6-e2e`
  - `/target/test-results/`
  - `/test_logs`

Release-blocking privacy assertions:
- `artifact_lifecycle_policy.json` must declare CI-safe redaction mode (`metadata_only` or `strict`).
- Required redacted fields must include `suite_log`.
- Retention days must be numeric and within CI cap.
- Every suite must keep replay and artifact routing enabled.

CI enforcement:
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` D4 gate validates lifecycle artifacts against
  `.github/security_release_policy.json.trace_telemetry_privacy`.
- Security release gate (`scripts/check_security_release_gate.py`) and CI report artifacts
  provide audit evidence for incident review.

## Threats and Mitigations by Component

### Runtime Core

Threats:
- Task starvation or scheduler deadlock (lost wakeups, cancel lane monopoly)
- Obligation leaks causing resource retention
- Budget bypass leading to unbounded work

Mitigations:
- Scheduler invariants and tests (lost wakeup, duplicate scheduling)
- Obligation tracking (reserve/commit/abort) with leak detection
- Budget propagation and checkpoint enforcement

### Cancellation Protocol

Threats:
- Silent drops of in-flight effects
- Unbounded cleanup on cancel

Mitigations:
- Two-phase effects for critical primitives
- Cancellation protocol: request -> drain -> finalize
- Lab runtime oracles: quiescence, obligation leak, loser drain

### TLS

Threats:
- Weak cipher negotiation or missing ALPN
- Invalid certificate acceptance
- Missing client auth options (mTLS)

Mitigations:
- rustls integration with explicit configuration
- ALPN negotiation required for HTTP/2 and gRPC
- Separate tasks for TLS conformance and mTLS

### HTTP/2

Threats:
- HPACK memory/CPU exhaustion
- Incomplete CONTINUATION sequences (connection-level DoS)
- PUSH_PROMISE abuse (resource leaks, stream ID exhaustion)
- Stream dependency violations

Mitigations:
- HPACK bounds, Huffman validation, recursion limits
- Continuation deadline and header block size caps
- Strict stream state machine checks
- Tests for flow control, SETTINGS, and GOAWAY

### gRPC

Threats:
- Oversized frames or metadata
- Stream reset abuse
- Inconsistent status mapping

Mitigations:
- Frame size caps and strict header validation
- Explicit status mapping from Outcome to gRPC codes
- Conformance and interop tests

### WebSocket

Threats:
- Incomplete close handshake leading to resource leaks
- Missing masking validation for client -> server frames
- Fragmentation abuse

Mitigations:
- RFC 6455 close handshake implementation
- Masking enforcement
- Message size caps and fragmentation limits

### Messaging Clients (Redis/NATS/Kafka)

Threats:
- Unbounded buffer growth in codecs
- Protocol state desync on partial frames
- Cancel-sensitive operations leaking resources

Mitigations:
- Incremental decoders with size limits
- Connection pool health checks
- Cancel-correct send/recv semantics

## Security Invariants (Must Hold)

- No unbounded allocations from untrusted input
- Protocol parsers are total: reject invalid input without panics
- All obligations resolved before task completion
- Cancellation does not drop committed effects
- Trace and replay must be deterministic and tamper-evident

## Testing Plan (Security-Focused)

Unit tests:
- Parser boundary tests for HTTP/2, HPACK, WebSocket, gRPC
- Obligation leak detection on task completion
- TLS configuration validation

Fuzz tests:
- HTTP/2 frame sequences
- HPACK header blocks
- WebSocket frame parser
- gRPC frame decoder

E2E tests:
- Protocol conformance suites where available
- Cancellation under load with structured logging

Lab runtime tests:
- Deterministic scheduling + oracle verification for security invariants

## Per-Protocol Size Limits (Current Defaults)

Documented size limits should be enforced at the codec or framing layer and be
configurable where appropriate. Current defaults:

- HTTP/1.1:
  - `src/http/h1/codec.rs`: `DEFAULT_MAX_HEADERS_SIZE` = 64 KiB, `DEFAULT_MAX_BODY_SIZE` = 16 MiB
  - `src/http/h1/codec.rs`: `MAX_HEADERS` = 128, `MAX_REQUEST_LINE` = 8192 bytes
  - `src/http/h1/client.rs`: same defaults for client decode
- HTTP/2:
  - `src/http/h2/settings.rs`: `DEFAULT_MAX_FRAME_SIZE` = 16384
  - `src/http/h2/settings.rs`: `DEFAULT_MAX_HEADER_LIST_SIZE` = 65536
  - `src/http/h2/settings.rs`: `DEFAULT_CONTINUATION_TIMEOUT_MS` = 5000
  - `src/http/h2/stream.rs`: `HEADER_FRAGMENT_MULTIPLIER` = 4 (fragment limit = 4x header list)
  - `src/http/h2/connection.rs`: HPACK decoder max header list size set from settings
- gRPC:
  - `src/grpc/codec.rs`: `DEFAULT_MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE` = 4 MiB
  - `src/grpc/server.rs` + `src/grpc/client.rs`: `max_recv_message_size` / `max_send_message_size` default 4 MiB
- WebSocket:
  - `src/net/websocket/frame.rs`: `FrameCodec::DEFAULT_MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE` = 16 MiB
  - `src/net/websocket/client.rs`: `WebSocketConfig` defaults: `max_frame_size` = 16 MiB, `max_message_size` = 64 MiB

## Fuzzing in CI (Current Targets)

Fuzz targets are documented in `fuzz/README.md` and wired into
`.github/workflows/fuzz.yml` for scheduled runs:

- `fuzz_http1_request` (HTTP/1 request parser)
- `fuzz_http1_response` (HTTP/1 response parser)
- `fuzz_hpack_decode` (HPACK decoder)
- `fuzz_http2_frame` (HTTP/2 frame parser)
- `fuzz_interest_flags` (reactor interest flags)

CI should run at least the critical targets with a bounded time budget, e.g.:

```
cargo +nightly fuzz run fuzz_http2_frame -- -max_total_time=300
cargo +nightly fuzz run fuzz_hpack_decode -- -max_total_time=300
```

Missing fuzz targets to add: WebSocket frame parser and gRPC message framing.

## Threat Model Checklist for New Protocol Modules

- Define explicit size limits (frame/header/message) with safe defaults
- Validate all state transitions; reject invalid sequences early
- Bound allocations derived from untrusted input
- Ensure cancellation-safe cleanup for in-flight operations
- Add deterministic lab tests covering edge cases
- Add a fuzz target + seeds and wire into CI
- Emit structured trace events for protocol errors (no stdout/stderr)

## Observability Requirements

- Emit structured trace events for security-relevant failures
- Record reasons for protocol errors (without leaking secrets)
- Never write to stdout/stderr in core runtime paths

## Automated Security Release Gate (`asupersync-umelq.14.5`)

The security release gate validates policy compliance in CI before every release.

- Policy: `.github/security_release_policy.json`
- Gate script: `scripts/check_security_release_gate.py`
- Report artifact: `artifacts/security_release_gate_report.json`
- Event log: `artifacts/security_release_gate_events.ndjson`

Release-blocking checks (SEC-BLOCK-01 through SEC-BLOCK-06):

1. **Dependency audit**: No forbidden runtime crates in WASM profiles.
2. **Capability authority**: FetchAuthority/StorageAuthority default-deny enforcement.
3. **Protocol bounds**: All protocol parsers enforce documented size limits.
4. **Telemetry redaction**: Sensitive data scrubbed before emission.
5. **Structured concurrency**: No orphan tasks or obligation leaks.
6. **Supply chain**: All conditional dependencies have non-expired transition plans.

Warning checks (non-blocking): fuzz target coverage, credential escalation prevention.

Adversarial scenarios (ADV-01 through ADV-06) are validated for test coverage against
`tests/security_invariants.rs`.

Validator commands:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_security_release_gate.py --self-test
python3 scripts/check_security_release_gate.py \
  --policy .github/security_release_policy.json
```

## Open Items (bd-2827)

- Add fuzz targets for WebSocket frame parsing and gRPC message framing
  - Tracked in `bd-1p2e` (WebSocket conformance + fuzz)
  - Tracked in `bd-27sd` (gRPC conformance + interop)
