**Program**: `asupersync-2oh2u` ([TOKIO-REPLACE])
**Author**: SapphireHill (claude-code / opus-4.6)
**Date**: 2026-03-04
**Review Version**: 1.0.0
**Status**: CONDITIONAL_GO
**Purpose**: Execute the GA readiness checklist using deterministic gate
outputs and migration-lab results, record a go/no-go launch decision,
and define post-launch monitoring commitments with accountable follow-ups.

## 1. Scope

This document executes the final GA readiness review for the Tokio-ecosystem
replacement program. It consumes outputs from:

- Replacement-readiness gate aggregator (`asupersync-2oh2u.10.9`, T8.9)
- Migration lab KPI results (`asupersync-2oh2u.11.10`, T9.10)
- Replacement claim RFC (`asupersync-2oh2u.11.8`, T9.8)

Prerequisites:
- `asupersync-2oh2u.11.10` (T9.10: migration lab KPIs)
- `asupersync-2oh2u.11.8` (T9.8: replacement claim RFC)
- `asupersync-2oh2u.10.9` (T8.9: readiness gate aggregator)

### 2.2 Aggregate Readiness Score

```
Readiness Score = Σ(weight_i × score_i)
               = 0.25×0.95 + 0.15×0.90 + 0.10×0.88 + 0.15×0.85
                 + 0.10×0.92 + 0.10×0.87 + 0.05×0.95 + 0.10×0.90
               = 0.2375 + 0.1350 + 0.0880 + 0.1275
                 + 0.0920 + 0.0870 + 0.0475 + 0.0900
               = 0.9045
```

**Aggregate Score: 0.9045**
**Gate Status: GO** (score >= 0.85 AND zero HARD_FAIL)

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Readiness score >= 0.85 | PASS | Score: 0.9045 |
| Zero HARD_FAIL gates | PASS | All 8 dimensions PASS |
| Zero Critical limitations | PASS | 0 Critical |
| Migration lab zero hard-fails | PASS | 48 KPIs, 0 hard-fails |
| Security audit clean | PASS | Zero unmitigated findings |
| Invariants preserved | PASS | 5/5 FULLY_PROVEN |
| 14-day soak test | PENDING | Required before GA promotion |
| External validation reports | PENDING | Required before RC promotion |

### 5.2 Launch Decision

**Decision: CONDITIONAL_GO**

The replacement program meets all automated gate criteria for GO status
(score 0.9045, zero HARD_FAIL). The decision is CONDITIONAL pending:

1. 14-day soak test completion (required for GA channel promotion)
2. External validation campaign execution (required for RC channel promotion)
3. Event pipeline FK-07 optimization (soft-fail follow-up)

### 5.3 Immediate Actions

| Action | Owner | Due Date | Priority |
|--------|-------|----------|----------|
| Execute 14-day soak test | Ops Lead | +14 days from RC promotion | P0 |
| Run external validation campaigns VC-01..VC-06 | Program Lead | Before RC promotion | P0 |
| File optimization bead for FK-07 cold-start | T6 Track Lead | +30 days | P1 |
| Schedule first incident drill (DRILL-01) | Ops Lead | +7 days from Beta promotion | P1 |
