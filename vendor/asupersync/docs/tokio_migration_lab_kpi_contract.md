labs that validate real-world usability of the Tokio replacement stack.

## 4. Friction KPIs

### 4.1 KPI Definitions

| KPI ID | Metric | Unit | Description |
|--------|--------|------|-------------|
| FK-01 | Time to First Successful Build | minutes | Time from migration start to first clean compilation |
| FK-02 | Time to All Tests Passing | minutes | Time from start to all unit+e2e tests green |
| FK-03 | Defect Escape Rate | count per service | Bugs found post-migration that existed pre-migration |
| FK-04 | Recovery Latency | minutes | Time to rollback and restore service after migration failure |
| FK-05 | Rollback Frequency | ratio | Fraction of lab runs requiring rollback |
| FK-06 | Support Burden | questions per service | Count of docs/cookbook lookups needed during migration |
| FK-07 | Code Change Volume | lines changed | Total lines added/removed/modified |
| FK-08 | Performance Delta | percentage | p99 latency change post-migration vs baseline |

### 4.2 Success Thresholds

| KPI ID | Threshold | Hard-Fail | Soft-Fail |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| FK-01 | <= 30 min | > 60 min | > 30 min |
| FK-02 | <= 60 min | > 120 min | > 60 min |
| FK-03 | 0 defects | >= 3 | >= 1 |
| FK-04 | <= 10 min | > 30 min | > 10 min |
| FK-05 | <= 10% | > 30% | > 10% |
| FK-06 | <= 5 lookups | > 15 | > 5 |
| FK-07 | <= 500 lines (S-01) | > 2000 | > 500 |
| FK-08 | <= 10% regression | > 50% | > 10% |

## 5. Lab Run Protocol

### 5.1 Lab Setup

```
1. Select persona (P-01..P-06) and service archetype (S-01..S-06)
2. Prepare baseline: build and test the service on tokio runtime
3. Record baseline metrics (compilation time, test count, p99 latency)
4. Start timer for FK-01
```

### 5.2 Migration Execution

```
1. Apply migration cookbook recipes for relevant tracks
2. Record each compilation attempt (pass/fail, duration)
3. Record each test run (pass count, fail count)
4. Note all cookbook/doc lookups (FK-06)
5. Stop timer when all tests pass (FK-02)
```

### 5.3 Verification

```
1. Run e2e service scripts (T5.12 patterns)
2. Verify structured log output (schema fields, correlation IDs)
3. Run performance benchmark (compare with baseline)
4. Record FK-03..FK-08 measurements
```

### 5.4 Artifact Emission

Every lab run MUST emit:
- `migration_lab_results.json` (structured KPI measurements)
- `migration_lab_log.md` (narrative timeline)
- Correlation IDs linking to e2e log entries
- Replay pointers for failed steps

## 6. Results Schema

### 6.1 Lab Results JSON

```json
{
  "schema_version": "migration-lab-results-v1",
  "lab_id": "lab-S01-P01-001",
  "persona_id": "P-01",
  "service_archetype": "S-01",

  },
  "outcome": "pass",
  "artifacts": [],
  "follow_up_beads": []
}
```

### 6.2 Follow-Up Bead Schema

When a KPI exceeds its hard-fail threshold, a follow-up bead MUST be created:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| kpi_id | yes | Which KPI failed |
| measured_value | yes | Actual measurement |
| threshold | yes | Expected threshold |
| severity | yes | hard-fail or soft-fail |
| remediation_hypothesis | yes | Proposed fix |
| owner | yes | Assigned agent/team |

## 7. Quality Gates

| Gate ID | Gate | Hard-Fail |
|---------|------|-----------|
| ML-01 | All personas represented | < 4 personas covered |
| ML-02 | All service archetypes covered | < 3 archetypes tested |
| ML-03 | KPI thresholds defined | any KPI without threshold |
| ML-04 | Artifact completeness | lab run missing required artifacts |
| ML-05 | Follow-up bead creation | hard-fail KPI without follow-up |
| ML-06 | Structured log compliance | lab artifacts without correlation IDs |
