# Replay Minimization, Counterexample Quality, and Distributed Inconsistency Debugging Contract

Bead: `asupersync-1508v.6.6`

## Purpose

This contract validates that the trace-intelligence pipeline (canonicalization, minimization, DPOR, geodesic normalization) produces correct, smaller, and more useful counterexamples without sacrificing replay determinism. Every validation scenario must demonstrate equivalence preservation, size reduction, and structured diagnostic output.

## Contract Artifacts

1. Canonical artifact: `artifacts/replay_minimization_validation_contract_v1.json`
2. Comparator-smoke runner: `scripts/run_replay_minimization_validation_smoke.sh`
3. Invariant suite: `tests/replay_minimization_validation_contract.rs`

## Validation Dimensions

### Dimension 1: Replay Equivalence After Canonicalization

Canonical (Foata normal form) traces must be replay-equivalent to originals:

- Fingerprint stability: same events yield same fingerprint across runs
- Layer ordering: Foata layers respect the independence relation
- Round-trip: canonicalize then linearize produces a valid linear extension

Owner: `src/trace/canonicalize.rs`

### Dimension 2: Minimization Quality

Delta-debugging and scenario-level minimization must produce strictly smaller traces:

- Hierarchical pruning: region subtrees are removed before fine-grained ddmin
- Minimality: every event in the result is necessary (removing any one loses the failure)
- Budget compliance: minimization respects `max_evaluations` cap

Owner: `src/trace/delta_debug.rs`, `src/trace/minimizer.rs`

### Dimension 3: Geodesic Normalization Correctness

Normalized traces must be valid linear extensions with reduced switch cost:

- Validity: normalized schedule respects happens-before
- Optimality: switch count is less than or equal to the original
- Fallback soundness: every fallback tier produces a valid result

Owner: `src/trace/geodesic.rs`

### Dimension 4: Race Detection Soundness

DPOR race analysis must be sound (no false negatives on known racing traces):

- Independent events: events on different resources are correctly independent
- Dependent events: events on the same resource with conflicting access are detected
- Coverage: race report includes all racing event pairs

Owner: `src/trace/dpor.rs`

### Dimension 5: Crash Pack Integrity

Crash packs must be self-contained, deterministic, and replayable:

- Schema version stability
- Fingerprint matches canonical trace fingerprint
- Replay command is well-formed and references the correct seed/config

Owner: `src/trace/crashpack.rs`

### Dimension 6: Divergence Diagnostics Quality

Divergence reports must pinpoint the exact failure location with context:

- First-violation isolation: correct event index
- Affected entity analysis: tasks and regions are identified
- Context window: surrounding events are included
- Structured output: JSON-serializable for CI

Owner: `src/trace/divergence.rs`

## Equivalence Invariants

1. `canonicalize(events)` preserves the set of events (no drops, no duplicates)
2. `trace_fingerprint(events) == trace_fingerprint(events)` (deterministic)
3. `normalize_trace(events, config)` returns `events.len()` events
4. `trace_switch_cost(normalized) <= trace_switch_cost(original)`
5. `detect_races(independent_events).is_race_free()` for truly independent events
6. Crash pack fingerprint matches `trace_fingerprint` of the same events

## Structured Logging Contract

Validation logs MUST include:

- `dimension`: Which validation dimension is being tested
- `trace_length`: Number of events in the test trace
- `canonical_fingerprint`: Foata fingerprint of the trace
- `switch_count_before`: Switch cost before normalization
- `switch_count_after`: Switch cost after normalization
- `minimization_ratio`: Ratio of minimized to original trace length
- `race_count`: Number of races detected
- `algorithm`: Algorithm used (geodesic tier, minimizer variant)

## Comparator-Smoke Runner

Canonical runner: `scripts/run_replay_minimization_validation_smoke.sh`

The runner reads `artifacts/replay_minimization_validation_contract_v1.json`, supports deterministic dry-run or execute modes, and emits:

1. Per-scenario manifests with schema `replay-minimization-validation-smoke-bundle-v1`
2. Aggregate run report with schema `replay-minimization-validation-smoke-run-report-v1`

Examples:

```bash
# List scenarios
bash ./scripts/run_replay_minimization_validation_smoke.sh --list

# Dry-run one scenario
bash ./scripts/run_replay_minimization_validation_smoke.sh --scenario AA06-VALID-CANONICALIZATION --dry-run

# Execute one scenario
bash ./scripts/run_replay_minimization_validation_smoke.sh --scenario AA06-VALID-CANONICALIZATION --execute
```

## Validation

Focused invariant test command (routed through `rch`):

```bash
rch exec -- env CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/rch-codex-aa063 cargo test --test replay_minimization_validation_contract -- --nocapture
```

Invariant coverage locks:

1. Doc section and cross-reference stability
2. Artifact schema/version invariants
3. Validation dimension catalog completeness
4. Canonicalization equivalence (fingerprint determinism, event preservation)
5. Normalization correctness (valid extension, switch cost reduction)
6. Race detection soundness (independent = no race, dependent = race)
7. Crash pack schema and fingerprint stability
8. Divergence report structure and context quality
9. Smoke command `rch` routing and report schema stability
