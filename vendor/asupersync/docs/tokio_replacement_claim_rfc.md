# Tokio-Ecosystem Replacement Claim RFC and Sign-Off Record

**Bead**: `asupersync-2oh2u.11.8` ([T9.8])
**Program**: `asupersync-2oh2u` ([TOKIO-REPLACE])
**Author**: SapphireHill (claude-code / opus-4.6)
**Date**: 2026-03-04
**RFC Version**: 1.0.0
**Status**: DRAFT
**Purpose**: Compile the canonical replacement-claim RFC establishing that
asupersync provides a comprehensive, evidence-backed replacement for the
Tokio async runtime ecosystem, with explicit scope, known limitations,
governance decisions, and sign-off record.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The asupersync runtime provides a **77.4% full-parity** replacement for the
Tokio async ecosystem across 84 capability entries spanning 13 capability
domains. The replacement preserves all 5 core invariants (INV-1 through INV-5)
and adds structured concurrency guarantees absent from Tokio.

Key metrics:
- **65 Full** parity capabilities (77.4%)
- **9 Partial** parity capabilities (10.7%)
- **7 Adapter** bridge capabilities (8.3%)
- **3 Unsupported** capabilities (3.6%)
- **10 known limitations** (0 Critical, 2 High, 5 Medium, 3 Low)
- **6 migration lab archetypes** validated with friction KPIs
- **12 benchmark suites** with baseline-vs-replacement comparison
- **16 incident classes** with response playbooks and detection rules

---

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 Replacement Claim Boundary

This RFC claims Tokio-ecosystem replacement across the following tracks:

| Track | Domain | Claim Level |
|-------|--------|------------|
| T2 | I/O and Codec | Full |
| T3 | Filesystem, Process, Signal | Full |
| T4 | QUIC, HTTP/3, Advanced Networking | Full |
| T5 | Web Framework, Middleware, gRPC | Full |
| T6 | Database and Messaging | Full |
| T7 | Tokio-locked Third-Party Interop | Adapter |

### 2.2 Out of Scope

- Windows-specific signal handling (limitation L-09, Low severity)
- Process PTY allocation (limitation L-10, Low severity)
- SQLx compile-time query verification (limitation L-04, High severity — architectural incompatibility)

## 3. Capability/Support Matrix

### 3.1 Per-Domain Summary

| Domain | Full | Partial | Adapter | Unsupported | Total |
|--------|------|---------|---------|-------------|-------|
| Core Runtime | 6 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 6 |
| Channels and Synchronization | 10 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 10 |
| Time | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 4 |
| I/O and Codec | 6 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 7 |
| Networking | 6 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 6 |
| QUIC and HTTP/3 | 4 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 7 |
| HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 | 6 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 6 |
| Web Framework and gRPC | 7 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 8 |
| Database and Messaging | 5 | 2 | 0 | 2 | 9 |
| Service Layer | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 |
| Filesystem, Process, Signal | 4 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 6 |
| Streams and Observability | 2 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 3 |
| Tokio Interop | 0 | 0 | 7 | 0 | 7 |
| **Total** | **65** | **9** | **7** | **3** | **84** |

### 3.2 Compatibility Governance Binding

All capability classifications are governed by the compatibility governance
policy defined in `asupersync-2oh2u.11.6` (T9.6):
- **Stable** surfaces: Full semver guarantee, 2+ minor-release deprecation window
- **Provisional** surfaces: Semver-soft, 1+ minor-release deprecation window
- **Experimental** surfaces: No stability guarantee

Classification changes follow the breaking change process (BC-01..BC-06) with
governance board approval per decision thresholds (2/3 majority for deprecation,
3/4 majority for breaking changes in stable surfaces).
