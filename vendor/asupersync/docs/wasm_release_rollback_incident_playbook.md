# WASM Release Rollback and Incident Response Playbook

Contract ID: `wasm-release-rollback-incident-playbook-v1`  
Bead: `asupersync-umelq.15.5`  
Depends on: `asupersync-umelq.15.4`, `asupersync-umelq.15.3`

## Purpose

Define deterministic operational response for Browser Edition release incidents.
This playbook covers:

1. incident severity classification and response ownership,
2. rollback triggers and exact rollback execution steps,
3. communication protocol and update cadence,
4. artifact revocation strategy for npm release channels,
5. postmortem and corrective-action requirements.

This playbook is release-governance only. It never weakens runtime invariants:
structured concurrency, cancellation protocol correctness, loser-drain behavior,
obligation closure, and explicit capability boundaries remain mandatory.

## Scope and Inputs

Primary automation surfaces:

- `.github/workflows/publish.yml`
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `docs/wasm_release_channel_strategy.md`

Primary incident evidence artifacts:

- `artifacts/security_release_gate_report.json`
- `artifacts/security_release_gate_events.ndjson`
- `artifacts/wasm_dependency_audit_summary.json`
- `artifacts/wasm_dependency_audit_log.ndjson`
- `artifacts/wasm_optimization_pipeline_summary.json`
- `artifacts/wasm/release/release_traceability.json`
- `artifacts/npm/npm_release_assumptions.json`
- `artifacts/npm/publish_outcome.json`
- `artifacts/npm/rollback_outcome.json`
- `artifacts/npm/rollback_actions.txt`

## Incident Severity Classification

| Severity | Trigger examples | Response target | Rollback default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SEV-1` | release-blocking security failure, malformed artifact provenance, reproducible deterministic replay failure in stable lane | immediate response | mandatory rollback |
| `SEV-2` | canary regression with user-facing breakage, package publish drift, rollback control failure | same-day response | rollback unless explicit waiver signed |
| `SEV-3` | non-blocking CI noise, documentation drift, optional artifact omissions | next business day | no automatic rollback |

## Incident Command Roles

- Incident Commander (IC): owns severity call, go/no-go decisions, and closure.
- Release Operator: executes deterministic command bundle and captures outputs.
- Comms Lead: publishes internal/external status updates.
- Scribe: records timeline, decisions, and artifact pointers for postmortem.

## Deterministic Triage Command Bundle

Run in this order and record every command + exit code:

```bash
# 1) Re-check release gating inputs
python3 scripts/check_wasm_optimization_policy.py \
  --policy .github/wasm_optimization_policy.json

python3 scripts/check_wasm_dependency_policy.py \
  --policy .github/wasm_dependency_policy.json

python3 scripts/check_security_release_gate.py \
  --policy .github/security_release_policy.json \
  --check-deps \
  --dep-policy .github/wasm_dependency_policy.json

# 2) Reproduce wasm compatibility contract checks (cargo-heavy via rch)
rch exec -- cargo test -p asupersync --test wasm_bundler_compatibility -- --nocapture
rch exec -- cargo test -p asupersync --test wasm_release_rollback_incident_playbook -- --nocapture
```

If any command fails, record:

1. failing command,
2. artifact path(s),
3. replay command,
4. incident severity,
5. initial rollback decision.

## Rollback Triggers

Rollback is mandatory when any condition is true:

1. `security_release_gate_report.json` indicates release-blocking failure.
2. dependency audit reports forbidden crate or expired transition.
3. deterministic replay evidence is missing for required promotion gates.
4. npm publish shows partial success or invalid channel/tag state.
5. `publish.yml` rollback controls fail validation.

## Rollback Procedure (Deterministic Order)

### A) WASM channel rollback

1. Freeze current promotion lane (`stable` or `canary`) and stop further publish jobs.
2. Demote candidate per `docs/wasm_release_channel_strategy.md`:
   - `stable -> canary`, or
   - `canary -> nightly`.
3. Archive failing artifacts and include replay command pointers.
4. Open remediation bead and link all incident artifacts before re-promotion.

### B) npm dist-tag rollback

When rollback target version is known, use `publish.yml` workflow-dispatch inputs:

- `rollback_npm_to_version=<known-good-version>`
- `rollback_reason=<incident-id-and-summary>`
- `npm_tag=<affected-tag>`

Workflow executes deterministic rollback via:

```bash
npm dist-tag add <package>@<known-good-version> <tag>
```

Action log and result evidence must include:

- `artifacts/npm/rollback_actions.txt`
- `artifacts/npm/rollback_outcome.json`

### C) Artifact revocation strategy

1. Keep latest bad build immutable for forensics; do not mutate evidence artifacts.
2. Reassign dist-tags to known-good versions; do not republish same semver with altered bytes.
3. Mark incident release as revoked in incident record and postmortem.
4. Require successful rerun of all gate commands before lifting rollback state.

## Communication Protocol

### Internal updates

- T+0: IC posts incident declaration with severity, trigger, and owner map.
- T+15m: first command-bundle status update with failing step and artifact paths.
- Every 30m for `SEV-1`/`SEV-2`: status heartbeat with new facts only.
- Resolution post: rollback status, residual risk, and next review checkpoint.

### External updates

- Stable-channel incidents require public status note with:
  - affected versions/tags,
  - mitigation (rollback/demotion),
  - expected next update time,
  - customer-safe workaround if available.

## Required Incident Artifacts

Each incident ticket must include:

1. timeline in UTC with decision points,
2. executed command bundle (exact commands),
3. artifact index with path + hash when available,
4. rollback decision record and authority,
5. replay command that reproduces the failing gate.

## Postmortem Requirements

Complete postmortem within 2 business days for `SEV-1`/`SEV-2`:

1. root cause statement (single-sentence and expanded form),
2. contributing factors and missing defenses,
3. what made detection fast/slow,
4. corrective actions with owner + due date,
5. explicit prevention checks to add to CI/release automation,
6. linkage to closed remediation bead IDs.

Postmortem cannot be marked complete without:

- at least one prevention action merged or explicitly scheduled with owner/due date,
- validation evidence showing prevention check executes deterministically,
- confirmation that rollback state has been lifted through gate-driven re-promotion.

## CI Certification Contract

`check` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` must run:

- step name: `WASM rollback and incident playbook certification`
- command:
  - `cargo test -p asupersync --test wasm_release_rollback_incident_playbook -- --nocapture`
- required artifacts:
  - `artifacts/wasm_release_rollback_playbook_summary.json`
  - `artifacts/wasm_release_rollback_playbook_test.log`

Local deterministic reproduction command:

```bash
rch exec -- cargo test -p asupersync --test wasm_release_rollback_incident_playbook -- --nocapture
```
