# doctor_asupersync Scenario Composer Contract

## Scope

This contract defines deterministic behavior for Track 3 scenario composition and
run-queue management (`asupersync-2b4jj.3.2`):

- reusable scenario template catalog
- deterministic request-to-queue entry composition
- queue ordering and dispatch policy semantics
- queue capacity and failure taxonomy requirements
- dependency contract versions required for execution + logging joins

The schema is represented by `ScenarioComposerContract` in
`src/cli/doctor/mod.rs`.

## Contract Version

- `doctor-scenario-composer-v1`
- depends on execution adapter `doctor-exec-adapter-v1`
- depends on logging contract `doctor-logging-v1`

## Determinism and Safety Invariants

1. `required_request_fields` and `required_run_fields` are lexical, duplicate-free, and include all required keys.
2. `scenario_templates` is non-empty and lexical by `template_id`.
3. Each template has non-empty description, lexical duplicate-free command/artifact lists, and `max_retries <= 8`.
4. Every `required_command_classes` member must exist in `doctor-exec-adapter-v1`.
5. If `requires_replay_seed=true`, template `default_priority` must be at least `100`.
6. Queue policy is bounded and deterministic:
   - `max_concurrent_runs > 0`
   - `max_queue_depth > 0`
   - `max_concurrent_runs <= max_queue_depth`
   - `dispatch_order == "priority_then_run_id"`
   - `cancellation_policy == "cancel_duplicate_run_id"`
7. Failure taxonomy is non-empty, lexical by `code`, and includes:
   - `invalid_seed`
   - `queue_full`
   - `unknown_template`
8. Failure severity must be one of `critical|high|medium|low`; `operator_action` must be non-empty.

## Compose Semantics

`compose_scenario_run(contract, request)` performs deterministic validation and
composition:

1. Validate the full contract before composing.
2. Require non-empty `run_id` and `requested_by`.
3. Require slug-like `correlation_id`.
4. Resolve `template_id` from `scenario_templates`; unknown template fails closed.
5. If template requires replay seed, `seed` must be non-empty and slug-like.
6. Use `priority_override` when provided, else template `default_priority`.
7. Emit queue entry with deterministic fields:
   - `queue_id = "queue-" + run_id`
   - initial `state = "queued"`
   - template command/artifact requirements copied directly

## Queue Build and Dispatch Semantics

`build_scenario_run_queue(contract, requests)`:

1. Validate contract and queue depth (`requests.len() <= max_queue_depth`).
2. Compose each request with `compose_scenario_run`.
3. Sort deterministically by:
   - descending `priority`
   - ascending `run_id`
   - ascending `template_id`

`dispatch_scenario_run_queue(contract, entries)`:

1. Validate contract and queue depth (`entries.len() <= max_queue_depth`).
2. Re-sort entries with the same deterministic ordering.
3. Mark first `max_concurrent_runs` entries as `running`.
4. Leave all remaining entries as `queued`.

## Failure Taxonomy and Runbook

- `invalid_seed`: caller supplied invalid or missing seed for seed-required template.
- `unknown_template`: caller referenced template not present in contract.
- `queue_full`: queue exceeded `max_queue_depth`; drain queue or adjust policy.

These failures are deterministic and suitable for replay in unit/E2E artifact
flows.

## Logging and Correlation Requirements

Scenario flows must preserve correlation and replay lineage with:

- `run_id`
- `template_id`
- `correlation_id`
- `seed`
- queue state transitions (`queued`/`running`)

These fields align with `doctor-logging-v1` for deterministic joins across
scenario decisions, execution commands, and diagnostics artifacts.

## Replay Launcher Workflow (Track 3.3)

`asupersync lab replay` is the deterministic replay launcher surface used by
doctor orchestration to rerun failures with pinned provenance.

### Canonical command shape

```bash
asupersync lab replay <scenario.yaml> \
  --seed <u64> \
  --artifact-pointer <path-or-uri> \
  --artifact-output <report.json> \
  --window-start <event-index> \
  --window-events <count> \
  --json
```

### Operational contract

1. `--seed` pins reruns to a deterministic execution seed.
2. `--artifact-pointer` carries a stable evidence pointer (path/URI/ticket ref)
   that can be joined with `doctor-logging-v1`.
3. `--artifact-output` writes the replay report JSON so automation can promote
   the exact payload into CI artifacts.
4. `--window-start` and `--window-events` parameterize replay-window reporting
   (requested vs resolved event range) for targeted forensic slices.
5. Replay output must include:
   - certificate identity (`event_hash`, `schedule_hash`, `trace_fingerprint`)
   - divergence payload when deterministic replay fails
   - exact rerun command payloads (`provenance.rerun_commands`)

These requirements keep replay execution reproducible across local runs, CI
jobs, and cross-agent handoffs.

### Troubleshooting workflow

Use the canonical E2E harness to validate replay launcher behavior and capture
artifactized evidence:

```bash
bash scripts/test_doctor_replay_launcher_e2e.sh
```

The harness executes two replay runs with identical seed/window parameters via
`rch`, verifies deterministic output equivalence, and emits a summary at:

- `target/e2e-results/doctor_replay_launcher/artifacts_<timestamp>/summary.json`
