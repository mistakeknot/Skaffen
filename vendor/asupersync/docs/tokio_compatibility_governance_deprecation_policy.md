# Compatibility Governance and Deprecation Policy

**Bead**: `asupersync-2oh2u.11.6` ([T9.6])
**Program**: `asupersync-2oh2u` ([TOKIO-REPLACE])
**Author**: SapphireHill (claude-code / opus-4.6)
**Date**: 2026-03-04
**Policy Version**: 1.0.0
**Dependencies**: `asupersync-2oh2u.11.10` (migration lab KPIs), `asupersync-2oh2u.11.5` (release channels)
**Purpose**: Define compatibility governance, API stability commitments,
deprecation policy, breaking-change management, exception handling,
escalation paths, and enforcement mechanisms for Tokio-replacement
surfaces across all release channels.

---

## 1. Scope

This policy governs how API compatibility is maintained, how deprecations are
communicated, and how breaking changes are managed across the replacement
surface lifecycle. It is grounded in:

- Release channels from `asupersync-2oh2u.11.5` (T9.5)
- Migration lab outcomes from `asupersync-2oh2u.11.10` (T9.10)
- Compatibility matrix from `asupersync-2oh2u.11.3` (T9.3)

Prerequisites:
- `asupersync-2oh2u.11.10` (T9.10: migration lab KPIs)
- `asupersync-2oh2u.11.5` (T9.5: release channels)

Downstream:
- `asupersync-2oh2u.11.8` (T9.8: replacement claim RFC)

## 3. Deprecation Process

### 3.1 Deprecation Lifecycle

```text
PROPOSAL ──→ REVIEW ──→ APPROVED ──→ DEPRECATED ──→ REMOVED
   │           │           │             │              │
   │           │           │             │              └─ Next major release
   │           │           │             └─ #[deprecated] + migration guide
   │           │           └─ Governance board approval
   │           └─ Impact assessment complete
   └─ RFC filed with rationale
```

### 3.2 Deprecation Notice Requirements

| Requirement ID | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| DN-01 | `#[deprecated(since, note)]` attribute on all deprecated items |
| DN-02 | Migration guide with before/after code examples |
| DN-03 | Changelog entry describing deprecation and rationale |
| DN-04 | Compiler warning with actionable replacement suggestion |
| DN-05 | Deprecation notice minimum duration per stability tier |

### 3.3 Deprecation Impact Assessment

Before deprecating any Stable or Provisional API:

| Step | Action | Owner |
|------|--------|-------|
| DIA-01 | Usage analysis across known consumers | Track lead |
| DIA-02 | Migration complexity estimate (FK-01 KPI) | QA lead |
| DIA-03 | Performance impact of replacement path | Performance engineer |
| DIA-04 | Compatibility matrix update | Governance board |
| DIA-05 | Migration cookbook entry | Documentation lead |

---

## 4. Breaking Change Management

### 4.1 Breaking Change Classification

| Class | Description | Allowed In | Approval Required |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| BC-01 | Type signature change | Major only | Governance board |
| BC-02 | Behavioral change (observable) | Major only | Governance board + RFC |
| BC-03 | Default value change | Minor (with deprecation) | Track lead |
| BC-04 | Feature removal | Major only | Governance board |
| BC-05 | Wire format change | Major only | Governance board + RFC |
| BC-06 | Performance regression > 10% | Blocked until fixed | Track lead |

### 4.2 Breaking Change RFC Process

1. **File RFC**: Author submits breaking change proposal with:
   - Technical rationale and alternatives considered
   - Impact assessment on known consumers
   - Migration path with estimated effort
   - Timeline and deprecation schedule

2. **Review period**: Minimum 14 days for Stable APIs, 7 days for Provisional

3. **Governance vote**: Quorum of 3+ governance board members

4. **Implementation**: Breaking change lands with:
   - Migration guide
   - Deprecation warnings in preceding release
   - Automated migration tool where feasible

## 8. Exception and Waiver Handling

### 8.1 Waiver Types

| Type | ID | Scope | Approval | Max Duration |
|------|----|-------|----------|-------------|
| Deprecation window reduction | WV-01 | Shorten deprecation window | Program Lead + 2 reviewers | 1 release cycle |
| Breaking change in stable | WV-02 | Permit BC-xx in RC/GA without full window | Program Lead + Engineering VP | 1 patch release |
| Performance budget override | WV-03 | Accept regression above threshold | Track Lead + QA Lead | Until next minor release |
| Gate bypass | WV-04 | Skip specific quality gate | Program Lead | 1 promotion cycle |

### 8.2 Waiver Constraints

All waivers must:
1. Document justification with evidence of necessity
2. Include risk assessment with blast-radius analysis
3. Specify follow-up bead with deadline for remediation
4. Be recorded in the waiver register (§8.3)
5. Trigger enhanced monitoring for affected surface
6. Expire automatically; no indefinite waivers

### 8.3 Waiver Register Schema

## 9. Escalation Paths

### 9.1 Escalation Triggers and Chains

| Trigger | ID | First Response | Escalation 1 | Escalation 2 | Timeline |
|---------|-----|---------------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Compatibility regression | ESC-01 | Track Lead triages | Program Lead within 4h | Engineering VP within 8h | 24h resolution |
| Deprecation window dispute | ESC-02 | Track Lead + author | Program Lead within 24h | Engineering VP within 48h | 1 week resolution |
| Emergency breaking change | ESC-03 | Track Lead + Program Lead | Engineering VP within 2h | CTO within 4h | Same-day resolution |
| Waiver request denied | ESC-04 | Program Lead review | Engineering VP appeal | Board review | 1 week resolution |
| Security vulnerability | ESC-05 | Track Lead + Program Lead | Engineering VP within 1h | Hotfix release within 8h | Same-day resolution |

### 9.2 Emergency Process

For security vulnerabilities (CVSS >= 7.0) or data-loss bugs:

| Step | ID | Action | Owner | Duration |
|------|----|--------|-------|----------|
| Triage | EM-01 | Classify severity, assess blast radius | Track Lead | 1h |
| Hotfix | EM-02 | Implement minimal fix | Author | 4h |
| Fast-track review | EM-03 | Single reviewer approval sufficient | Program Lead | 2h |
| Release | EM-04 | Patch release with advisory | Program Lead | 8h total |
| Retroactive RFC | EM-05 | File RFC within 72h post-release | Author | 72h |
| Post-mortem | EM-06 | Document incident and process improvements | Track Lead | 1 week |

---

## 10. Invariant Preservation

All governance decisions must preserve the five core invariants:

| Invariant | ID | Governance Constraint |
|-----------|----|--------------------|
| No ambient authority | INV-1 | No change may introduce ambient runtime access |
| Structured concurrency | INV-2 | No change may bypass region-scoped task ownership |
| Cancellation is a protocol | INV-3 | No change may introduce silent cancellation |
| No obligation leaks | INV-4 | No change may create untracked obligations |
| Outcome severity lattice | INV-5 | No change may violate severity ordering |

Any proposed change that would weaken an invariant requires:
- Explicit invariant-impact assessment in the RFC
- Formal proof update if Lean theorem is affected
- Program Lead + Engineering VP approval
- Enhanced monitoring post-release

---

## 11. Staleness and Freshness Policy

| Metric | Warning Threshold | Hard-Fail Threshold | Action |
|--------|------------------|--------------------|---------|
| Compatibility matrix age | 30 days | 60 days | Block promotions until refreshed |
| Deprecation log review | 14 days | 30 days | Escalate to Program Lead |
| Waiver register audit | 30 days | 60 days | All active waivers expire |
| Policy document age | 90 days | 180 days | Mandatory review cycle |
