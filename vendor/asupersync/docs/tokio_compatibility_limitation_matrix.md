## 1. Scope

This document provides:
- Per-capability compatibility classification (Full, Partial, Unsupported, Adapter)
- Concrete rationale for each classification backed by test evidence
- User-impact assessment for each limitation
- Mitigation guidance, escalation path, and ownership for every gap
- Machine-readable JSON schema for downstream tooling

## 2. Classification Definitions

| Status | Symbol | Definition | CI Requirement |
|--------|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Full | F | Feature-complete replacement; all parity contracts satisfied | Hard-fail gate passes |
| Partial | P | Core functionality replaced; known feature gaps documented | Hard-fail gate passes for covered surface |
| Adapter | A | Functionality available via asupersync-tokio-compat bridge | Bridge compile + conformance tests pass |
| Unsupported | U | Not available; workaround or external crate required | Documented in gap register |
| Planned | Z | Scheduled for future release; not yet available | Tracked in roadmap |

## 4. Limitation Register

### 4.1 Active Limitations

| Lim ID | Capability | Status | User Impact | Mitigation | Escalation | Owner |
|--------|-----------|--------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| L-01 | QUIC connection migration | P | Mobile clients may experience drops on network change | Enable retry; use connection ID persistence | File upstream if quinn API changes | T4 |
| L-02 | HTTP/3 push promise | P | Server push not available; use HTTP/2 or preload hints | Fallback to HTTP/2 push | Planned for post-1.0 | T4 |
| L-03 | 0-RTT replay protection | P | Server-side replay detection incomplete | Disable 0-RTT for sensitive endpoints | T4 track priority | T4 |
| L-04 | SQLx compile-time checks | U | Cannot use sqlx::query! macro | Use runtime query validation or manual SQL | Not planned (requires tokio build dep) | T6 |
| L-05 | rdkafka StreamConsumer | P | StreamConsumer requires tokio runtime handle | Use BaseConsumer or tokio-compat bridge | Evaluate with rdkafka maintainers | T6 |
| L-06 | Redis cluster failover | P | Cluster topology changes may cause brief unavailability | Implement retry with exponential backoff | T6 track improvement | T6 |
| L-07 | NATS JetStream | P | Consumer/producer API partial; basic pub/sub complete | Use basic NATS for now; JetStream tracked | T6 track improvement | T6 |
| L-08 | gRPC reflection | U | Cannot use grpc_cli or grpcurl for discovery | Use proto files directly; document endpoints | Low priority (dev tooling) | T5 |
| L-09 | Windows signal handling | P | ctrl_break and ctrl_close signals partial | Use ctrl_c (works); document Windows limitations | Platform completeness track | T3 |
| L-10 | Process PTY | U | No pseudoterminal support for interactive processes | Use external crate (portable-pty) | Out of scope for core | T3 |

### 4.2 Limitation Rationale

Each limitation is classified based on:

| Factor | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| User workflow blockage | 0.30 | Does this prevent a common migration path? |
| Workaround availability | 0.25 | Can users achieve the same result another way? |
| Downstream dependency count | 0.20 | How many crates/services depend on this? |
| Implementation complexity | 0.15 | Engineering effort to resolve |
| Safety/correctness risk | 0.10 | Does the limitation affect invariant preservation? |

### 4.3 Limitation Severity Classification

| Severity | Criteria | Count |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Critical | Blocks common migration; no workaround | 0 |
| High | Blocks some migrations; workaround exists but costly | 2 (L-04, L-05) |
| Medium | Affects niche workflows; reasonable workaround | 5 (L-01, L-02, L-03, L-06, L-07) |
| Low | Affects rare workflows; trivial workaround or out of scope | 3 (L-08, L-09, L-10) |

---

## 5. Migration Lab Evidence Summary

The classifications above are grounded in migration lab outcomes from T9.10:

| Archetype | Lab Result | Friction KPIs Met | Limitations Encountered |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|
| REST CRUD API | Full migration successful | All 8 KPIs pass | None |
| gRPC microservice | Full migration successful | All 8 KPIs pass | L-08 (reflection not needed in prod) |
| Event pipeline (Kafka) | Partial migration | 7/8 KPIs pass (FK-07 exceeded) | L-05 (StreamConsumer workaround) |
| Real-time WebSocket | Full migration successful | All 8 KPIs pass | None |
| CLI tool | Full migration successful | All 8 KPIs pass | None |
| Hybrid Tokio-compat | Full migration via bridge | All 8 KPIs pass | Bridge overhead within NF28 budgets |

## 6. Invariant Preservation Status

All compatibility classifications preserve the five core invariants:

| Invariant | Status | Enforcement |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| INV-1: No ambient authority | Preserved | All adapters receive Cx explicitly |
| INV-2: Structured concurrency | Preserved | Region-owned tasks in all paths |
| INV-3: Cancellation is a protocol | Preserved | CancelAware on all adapter futures |
| INV-4: No obligation leaks | Preserved | Region close releases all obligations |
| INV-5: Outcome severity lattice | Preserved | Results mapped to Ok/Err/Cancelled/Panicked |
