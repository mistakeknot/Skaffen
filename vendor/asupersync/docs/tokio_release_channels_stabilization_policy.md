# Release Channels and Stabilization Policy for Replacement Surfaces

**Bead**: `asupersync-2oh2u.11.5` ([T9.5])
**Program**: `asupersync-2oh2u` ([TOKIO-REPLACE])
**Date**: 2026-03-04
**Purpose**: Define release channels, promotion criteria, stabilization policy,
and rollback triggers for Tokio-replacement surfaces with objective,
evidence-based gates at each stability tier.

---

## 1. Scope

This policy governs the lifecycle of all Tokio-replacement API surfaces from
initial development through general availability. It is grounded in:

- Readiness gate aggregator from `asupersync-2oh2u.10.9` (T8.9)
- Migration lab KPI outcomes from `asupersync-2oh2u.11.10` (T9.10)
- Compatibility matrix from `asupersync-2oh2u.11.3` (T9.3)
- Incident-response playbooks from `asupersync-2oh2u.10.10` (T8.10)

Prerequisites:
- `asupersync-2oh2u.11.10` (T9.10: migration lab KPIs)
- `asupersync-2oh2u.10.9` (T8.9: readiness gate aggregator)
- `asupersync-2oh2u.11.3` (T9.3: compatibility matrix)
- `asupersync-2oh2u.10.10` (T8.10: incident-response playbooks)

Downstream:
- `asupersync-2oh2u.11.7` (T9.7: external validation)
- `asupersync-2oh2u.11.6` (T9.6: compatibility governance)

## 2. Release Channels

### 2.1 Channel Definitions

| Channel | Stability | API Guarantee | Audience | Cadence |
|---------|-----------|---------------|----------|---------|
| Alpha | Experimental | None; breaking changes expected | Contributors, early adopters | On-demand |
| Beta | Stabilizing | Semver-soft; deprecation warnings before removal | Integration testers, pilot users | Monthly |
| RC | Release Candidate | Semver-hard; no API breaks without RFC | Production pilots | As-needed |
| GA | General Availability | Full semver; LTS commitment | All users | Per roadmap |

### 2.2 Channel Feature Flags

Each replacement surface is gated by a feature flag:

```toml
[features]
# Alpha surfaces (opt-in)
tokio-replace-io-alpha = []
tokio-replace-fs-alpha = []
tokio-replace-quic-alpha = []
tokio-replace-web-alpha = []
tokio-replace-db-alpha = []
tokio-replace-interop-alpha = []

# Beta surfaces (opt-in, more stable)
tokio-replace-io-beta = ["tokio-replace-io-alpha"]
tokio-replace-fs-beta = ["tokio-replace-fs-alpha"]

# GA surfaces (default-on)
tokio-replace-io = ["tokio-replace-io-beta"]
```

## 6. Exception Handling

### 6.1 Waiver Process

When a promotion gate cannot be satisfied:

1. **Document**: File waiver request with justification and risk assessment
2. **Assess**: Track lead evaluates risk vs. blocking impact
3. **Approve**: Per rollback authority table (§4.2)
4. **Monitor**: Enhanced monitoring for waived dimension
5. **Remediate**: Follow-up bead created with deadline

### 6.2 Waiver Schema

```json
{
  "schema_version": "promotion-waiver-v1",
  "waiver_id": "WV-T6-20260304-001",
  "track": "T6",

  "gate_id": "PC-R05",
  "justification": "Performance 1.3x baseline; optimization bead filed",
  "risk_level": "Medium",
  "approved_by": "Program lead",
  "expires_at": "2026-04-04T00:00:00Z",
  "follow_up_bead": "asupersync-2oh2u.X.Y",
