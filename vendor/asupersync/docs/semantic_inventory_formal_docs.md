## 1. Purpose

This document provides the DOC-layer citation map for the semantic drift
inventory. Every concept from the schema's completeness checklist is mapped to
its precise location in the two canonical specification documents:

| Document | Path | Abbreviation |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Formal Operational Semantics | `docs/asupersync_v4_formal_semantics.md` | FOS |
| Design Bible (Plan v4) | `asupersync_plan_v4.md` | PV4 |

Line numbers are stable as of commit `cd8068f2` (2026-03-02). Citations use the
format `DOC:<file_abbrev>:<line>` per the schema's four-layer citation spec.
