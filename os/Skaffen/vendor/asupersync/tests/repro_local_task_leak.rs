// This test file was an attempt to reproduce a local task leakage bug via integration testing.
// However, due to API limitations (accessing RuntimeState from tasks) and environment issues
// (SIGHUP on test execution), the reproduction was moved to a unit test in:
// src/runtime/scheduler/three_lane.rs -> test_local_task_cross_thread_wake_routes_correctly
//
// This file is preserved as an artifact but is not a functional test.
